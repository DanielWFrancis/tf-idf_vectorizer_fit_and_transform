# tf-idf_vectorizer_fit_and_transform
A short tutorial to go with a [blog post](http://dfrancis.co/2017/10/06/tf-idf-vectorizer-fit-and-transform/) I wrote about playing with tf-idf. Some of the lists in the iPython notebook are very long, so cloning it to your machine and looking at it on there will probably be more pleasant than using Github's .ipnyb viewer.
