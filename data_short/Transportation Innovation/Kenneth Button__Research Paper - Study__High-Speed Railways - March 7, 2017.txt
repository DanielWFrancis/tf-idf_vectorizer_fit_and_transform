 b"High-Speed Railways: Do They Produce Economic Growth? Kenneth Button  MERCATUS RESEARCH  Kenneth Button. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh-Speed Railways: Do They Produce Economic Growth?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercatus Research, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, March 2017.  ABSTRACT The debate surrounding the economic benefits of extending the US high-speed passenger rail system beyond the small stretch between Washington, DC, and New York City has abated somewhat but remains of policy interest. One of the justifications advocates cite for high-speed rail (HSR) is that it can provide important stimuli to the national and select regional economies. That argument is difficult to assess in the abstract, but it may be possible to glean some insights by studying systems that operate elsewhere. To that end, this paper examines the information available regarding the world\xe2\x80\x99s three largest HSR systems\xe2\x80\x94those of China, Japan, and Spain. The approach is not only to look at the broad effects of those systems on the macroeconomic development of the countries involved but also to consider their more localized, regional implications. The investigation is hindered by fragmented data and data gaps, particularly gaps in data about the financial costs and opportunity costs of HSR systems. What does emerge is that, although politicians and rail enthusiasts have widely supported HSR infrastructure investment as a catalyst for economic development, academic writings abound with considerable skepticism about the economic value of such investment. Furthermore, in virtually all cases, the development argument presented in support of HSR has proved to be overly optimistic, and the anticipated economic growth effects have been minimal or even negative. Where ex ante justification has been for a geographical shift of economic activity\xe2\x80\x94typically away from congested to economically deprived locations\xe2\x80\x94the outcomes have seldom been as hoped.

S  upporters of extending the US high-speed rail (HSR) system beyond the small stretch between Washington, DC, and New York City continue to claim that such extension can produce significant local, and often national, economic growth. This paper examines what has happened in Japan, Spain, and China, countries that have the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest HSR systems. The paper focuses on the still very embryonic and fragmented evidence that is available on the narrow economic implications of investment in HSR and largely neglects other claimed potential benefits, such as advancing political cohesion, meeting a need for accessibility, or offering a more environmentally friendly alternative to other forms of transportation. This singular focus is in no way meant to decry the importance of the debates surrounding those latter topics, but the aim of this paper is to help clarify one specific area of interest rather than to indulge in what often has become a confusion of muddled arguments involving double counting and selective data. By its nature, the topic is not easy to examine. Clear experiments allowing the distinct evaluation of the effect of HSR on economic growth do not exist, nor does any unequivocal way of defining counterfactuals to examine the implications of diverting resources from alternative uses to build HSR tracks. In addition, planning, financing, constructing, and building patronage for a new rail service takes time, and over that period many things can change. Even discussion of a new HSR link can elicit preemptive business decisions and alter related actions of local governments, making it difficult subsequently to establish a baseline against which the consequences of an HSR service can be gauged. HSR rail investments also often are part of a wider package of measures that may have been initiated anyway, making the HSR effect difficult to disentangle. The situation is not impossible to analyze, however. By making quite conservative assumptions and disentangling, where possible, the genuine economic growth effects of introducing HSR services in situations in which investments have been made, rather than by hypothecating what may happen, analysts may glean some reasonable insights. The three national case studies examined were  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  3  \xe2\x80\x9cThe three national case studies examined were selected not only because they involve the largest HSR systems and thus are important in their own right but also because they represent different technologies and geographies and were created at different times.\xe2\x80\x9d  selected not only because they involve the largest HSR systems and thus are important in their own right but also because they represent different technologies and geographies and were created at different times.  TRANSPORTATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH The practical question is whether any handle at all can be put on the broad economic growth effects of high-speed rail investment. A reasonable starting point when looking at any investment is to focus on the financial returns involved if the market were to make the investment. As this paper reveals, those returns often would not support investment in high-speed rail services. That is a legitimate way of considering the gains from an investment: individuals, without being coerced, are putting their own assets into a project, anticipating a financial return from it. The traditional difficulty, and one highlighted by free-market theorist Adam Smith, has been that some investments are too large for private institutions to sufficiently fund and would be unexplored without government direction. To be charitable, one could use that argument to support public financing of high-speed railways. The problem is that it does not explain HSR\xe2\x80\x99s generally poor financial performance; a government investment, using Smith\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, should earn the same return as an investment by a group of private-sector investors if the latter could be organized. The contemporary case for using public-sector money (or guarantees, for which government bears the burden of risk) is that markets are imperfect, and those imperfections tend toward suboptimally low investments. Imperfections often cited include imperfect information on the part of investors, monopoly market power of network owners, the public good elements of transportation, and the existence of negative environmental externalities. In the transportation context, publicly subsidized investment often is justified if alternative modes are underpriced, and that is the secondbest argument for using public-sector financing. This paper  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  4  does not reiterate the pros and cons of the plethora of such arguments that are regularly trolled through political debates. The focus of this study is on how the effects of HSR may, in general, be measured and what the implications are for economic growth. The traditional transportation approach assumes that markets are functioning perfectly\xe2\x80\x94or, at least, that the imperfections are minimal and thus can largely be ignored. That allows the effects of any investment to be measured in terms of the net benefits enjoyed by those making use of the transportation improvements. Transportation user effects include, at a minimum, time savings and direct financial returns.1 The underlying rationale is that to extend analysis further leads to double counting. For example, including a company\xe2\x80\x99s additional productivity as a result of quicker travel times for its employees may simply be mirroring what has been captured in time savings or financial returns associated with the enhanced transportation system. That approach, which underlies most transportation benefit-cost analysis, is, however, partial equilibrium in its orientation. It often seems to ignore wider changes that a major piece of new infrastructure may induce, for example, causing economic growth by shifting the production function in addition to moving along it. Anthony Venables\xe2\x80\x99s work at the World Bank points to the possibility that better transportation brings economic agents closer together and can trigger beneficial relocation of economic activity as firms and households respond to new opportunities.2 In figure 1, the left segment is the standard transportation benefit assessment whereby transportation investment reduces the costs of access, which generates benefits for its users. The right side shows that better transportation can also, in some circumstances, shape the effective density of economic activity, and thus productivity, in a way not fully captured in the direct effects of faster or cheaper journeys. That type of outcome often is seen as a development effect and should be distinguished from a Keynesian stimulus. The latter is about comparative statics and is concerned with shifting the economy from one level of output to another. Development effects in this context are about producing a higher, sustained increase in GDP. Transportation improvements can, all else equal, make a different set of locations more attractive for residents, workers, and firms, inducing investment 1. Some care must be exercised in doing even this. Most HSR systems engage in price discrimination, resulting in many of the time savings benefits being captured in fare revenues. 2.

Those changes may generate agglomeration and productivity effects. In particular, they may allow economies of scale to be realized and gains from specialization to be reaped. Labor supply may also be changed, on the supply side, with transportation enhancement enabling greater and more efficient labor force participation. The demand side carries a caveat, however: that although jobs will be created in some places, jobs may be lost in others. Further, in most cases, much of the traffic using new transportation services, such as HSR, is transfer traffic from other modes serving the same origins and destinations. Although transportation users will gain from that change, it will cause less of a shift in resources than will HSR routes in new geographical areas. In summary, the changed transportation system will have both trade creation and trade diversion effects. Broad estimates of the relative sizes of the transportation and wider economic implications of major infrastructure investments are, because of their diversity, difficult to make. What we do know is that, in general, they are not that large. In a meta-analysis of about 563 estimates, Melo, Graham, and Brage-Ardao found that transportation has a very small effect on productivity; a 10 percent  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  6  increase in public investment leads to only a 0.5 percent increase in output.3 When including such effects for specific investments, however, the devil lies in the details, as Venables recognizes: \xe2\x80\x9cIncorporating wider economic impacts in CBA [cost-benefit analysis] is challenging and has its own risks. Broadening the set of mechanisms that are studied creates the risk that bad arguments may appear to be legitimized, and that effects can be exaggerated. Studies tend to concentrate on areas where a transportation improvement expands economic activity, and to ignore areas from which this activity may have been displaced.\xe2\x80\x9d Implicit in that concept is the very serious possibility that improvements enjoyed by the transportation users of the infrastructure and paid for by those users are double counted as wider economic benefits. Considering the narrow HSR transportation effects, attempts have been made to define thresholds above which HSR would emerge as viable from a narrow, transportation perspective. The results are remarkably similar. Gines de Rus and Gustavo Nombela, using European engineering data combined with revenue- and time-saving benefits, conclude that the first-year patronage would have to be from 8 to 10 million passengers on a 310-mile route, generally taken as the optimal distance for HSR, to make HSR competitive with alternative transportation modes.4 Roger Vickerman, also focusing on patronage, finds that a demand for between 12 and 15 million passengers is needed for commercial viability.5 Those findings are also broadly in line with those of Peter Hall, who, taking a more geographical approach, found HSR viable only \xe2\x80\x9cbetween major urban agglomerations with over one million population . . . [when] such agglomerations are disposed along linear corridors, with cities spaced at approximately 125-mile intervals.\xe2\x80\x9d6 The Commission of the European Union reaches similar conclusions: \xe2\x80\x9conly exceptional circumstances (i.e., a combination based on low construction costs and time savings) may justify a new high-speed line with a passenger minimum volume of 6 million users in the initial year. With normal construction costs and standard time savings, a demand of 9 million is probably  3. Patrica C. Melo, Daniel J.

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  7  necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d7 If those were the criteria actually adopted, few HSR systems would ever be constructed.  THE NATURE OF HIGH-SPEED RAILWAYS The idea that fast railways have benefits beyond those immediately enjoyed by travelers is certainly not new. A fairly typical view is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe close relationship between railroad expansion and the general development and prosperity of the country is nowhere brought more distinctly into relief than in connection with the construction of the Pacific railroads.\xe2\x80\x9d8 Railway technology changes, however, and even if that view is true, its validity has varied over time. The definition of HSR is malleable and has changed depending on the technology of the historic period being considered and the underlying politics of its context. It can also vary by country.9 Technology is obviously a constraint to speed and has affected definitions of HSR over time. It has, for example, moved forward considerably since the opening of the first inter-city railway in 1830 between Liverpool and Manchester in England. At that time, 20 miles per hour (mph) was \xe2\x80\x9chigh speed.\xe2\x80\x9d Subsequent technology advances allowed operating speed to reach more than 65 mph by 1900. Today, HSR has no global definition. It is broadly defined as a type of rail transportation that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, usually using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. Countries vary as to what \xe2\x80\x9cfaster\xe2\x80\x9d means, but new lines in excess of 155 mph and existing lines in excess of 125 mph are widely considered to be high speed. Many systems, as discussed herein, exceed those minima. Although many of the physical changes are clearly visible to anyone looking at the locomotives and carriages, many other changes extend well beyond those modes of transport and add to the costs of HRS. In terms of infrastructure, for example, because track tends to separate, the original laying of track in the 1830s on individual stone blocks\xe2\x80\x94not the engine\xe2\x80\x94was the main constraint on speed. Modern high-speed rail track (a) is laid on sleepers of steel or plastic to tie it together, (b) is welded to prevent cracking at joints and to allow for  7.

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  8  the contraction and expansion associated with variable climatic conditions, (c) is cambered at turns to stop train displacement, (d) involves grade separation to remove junction problems, and (e) is electronically monitored to detect damage. Institutionally important, high-speed rail services use a standard gauge of track that allows for international running of trains. High-speed rail is, in addition, an intelligent transportation system in the sense that it makes extensive use of modern information systems to monitor and control operations and to refine prices to achieve revenue targets. That capability is particularly important when the high-speed system shares infrastructure with other rail services. Without such technology, considerable constraints would be placed on speeds on both dedicated rail track and shared track, most notably the latter.  DIFFERENT FORMS OF HSR SYSTEMS Different geography, history, economics, and political priorities mean that HSR systems differ considerably by country. Figure 2 illustrates details of the situation in Europe and East Asia (excluding some lines into the hinterland of China), highlighting not only the geography of the systems but also the engineering differences in terms of attainable speeds. A key difference in Spain\xe2\x80\x99s HSR and those of Japan and China is that Spain\xe2\x80\x99s is part of a much larger European system, whereas the East Asian systems are separate entities, unconnected to other national systems. The roles of East Asia\xe2\x80\x99s HSRs are thus much more oriented to the internal economies of the countries involved than to integration of economies within any larger economic block. Geographically, Spain is in many ways like the 48 contiguous states of the United States in that it is basically rectangular in shape, with concentrations of population and economic activity at the center and in the corners. That layout is conducive to hub-and-spoke networks because of the ability to use the central location (in Spain, Madrid) as a hub  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  9  \xe2\x80\x9cGeographically, Spain is in many ways like the 48 contiguous states of the United States in that it is basically rectangular in shape, with concentrations of population and economic activity at the center and in the corners.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cardiff  Rotterdam  Birmingham  Leeds York Liverpool Manchester Sheffield  Newcastle  Edinburgh  Oslo  Bremen Amsterdam  Malm\xc3\xb6  Hannover Leipzig  Berlin Pozna\xc5\x84 \xc5\x81\xc3\xb3d\xc5\xba  Gda\xc5\x84sk  Warszawa  R\xc4\xabga  Tallinn  Vilnius  Mikkeli  Helsinki  Lahti  Kaliningrad  Stockholm  Uppsala  Turku  Link\xc3\xb6ping  V\xc3\xa4ster\xc3\xa5s  Hamburg  Arhus K\xc3\xb8benhavn  Kristiansand G\xc3\xb6teborg  Stavanger  Bergen  Tampere  Sein\xc3\xa4joki  Ume\xc3\xa5 Trondheim Sundsvall  Minsk  Kyiv  Bryansk  Smolensk  Sankt-Peterburg  Kharkiv  Kursk  Moskva  Donets'k Bristol London Antwerpen Dnipropetrovs'k Wroc\xc5\x82aw K\xc3\xb6ln Essen L'viv Bruxelles/Brussel Rostov-na-Donu Erfurt Dresden Krak\xc3\xb3w Katowice Lille Frankfurt Li\xc3\xa8ge Cherbourg Le Havre Praha Luxemboug Ostrava Rouen N\xc3\xbcrnberg Brno Brest Mannheim Paris Le Mans Stuttgart Rennes Strasbourg Odesa M\xc3\xbcnchen Wien Chi\xc5\x9fin\xc4\x83u Bratislava Budapest Basel Cluj-Napoca Dijon Salzburg Nantes Tours Sevastopol' Z\xc3\xbcrich Graz Innsbruck Bern Bra\xc5\x9fov Ljubljana ClermontFerrand Gen\xc3\xa8ve Constan\xc5\xa3a Milano Lyon Bucure\xc5\x9fti Zagreb Bordeaux Venezia A Coru\xc3\xb1a Beograd Verona Santiago de Oviedo Varna Torino Genova Bologna Compostela Bilbao Sarajevo Montpellier Burgas Toulouse Vigo Le\xc3\xb3n Firenze Split Sofia Pri\xc5\xa1tina Nice Palencia \xc4\xb0stanbul Sivas Podgorica Marseille Zamora Porto Perpignan Valladolid Huesca Skopje Ankara Olmedo Bursa Bilecik K\xc4\xb1r\xc4\xb1kkale Salamanca Roma Zaragoza Barcelona Eski\xc5\x9fehir Madrid Tiran\xc3\xab Bari Thessalon\xc3\xadki Sassari Napoli Olbia Afyon Toledo Konya Adana Lisboa \xc4\xb0zmir Val\xc3\xa8ncia Albacete C\xc3\xb3rdoba Ath\xc3\xadna Ja\xc3\xa9n Cagliari Huelva Alacant Murcia P\xc3\xa1tra Sevilla Faro Palermo Cartagena C\xc3\xa1diz M\xc3\xa1laga Almer\xc3\xada Catania  Cork  Dublin  Belfast  Glasgow  Legend : 310 - 320 km/h 190 - 200 mph 270 - 300 km/h 165 - 185 mph 240 - 260 km/h 150 - 160 mph 200 - 230 km/h 125 - 145 mph < 125 mph < 200 km/h Under construction/ upgrading  FIGURE 2.

The hub is used for interchanging passengers traveling between the various centers around the edge of the rectangular market. In contrast, although the Tokyo metropolitan area is by far the largest city in Japan, much of the remainder of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s population is concentrated along its southern coast, making linear rather than hub-and spoke services more efficient. Trains pick up and drop off passengers at stations along routes to generate scope and density efficiencies. China\xe2\x80\x99s economy is in many ways akin to that of the European Union, with most of its activities and population bunched in a highly congested part of its geography in the southern and eastern areas of the country. Such a layout favors rail services radiating from a number of base cities as the most efficient system. Indeed, those are the patterns of services supplied by airlines, the main competitor to HSR in the three cases considered in this paper. Airlines and HSRs display similarities and differences, however. Both have the spatial economic development feature that when they do stimulate economic growth, it is around their nodal points\xe2\x80\x94not along the links, which provide de facto zero accessibility to either form of transportation. Indeed, in that context, the French economist Alain Bonnafous once argued that the TGV, France\xe2\x80\x99s HSR system, should be seen as a low-flying Airbus. Although that is a nice, succinct analogy, the problem is not newly appreciated. About 25 years ago, geographers Klaus Spiekermann and Michael Wegener put it very simply: \xe2\x80\x9cHigh-speed infrastructure connects only important cities, but not the space in between them.\xe2\x80\x9d10 But to talk of HSR \xe2\x80\x9cnetworks\xe2\x80\x9d as is done with airlines is often misleading; indeed, that is why the moniker \xe2\x80\x9cHSR systems\xe2\x80\x9d is used throughout this paper. Networks imply interconnectivity of a hub-and-spoke nature, with users enjoying the interoperability of being able to, in the case of HSRs, change trains to reach a variety of destinations. That is the concept underlying airline hub-andspoke networks. To make that concept attractive, the overall time penalty of changing trains, as opposed to taking a direct service, must be relatively small in terms of both link and transfer times. Although that is often true for airlines, as we see in the following examples, it is seldom the case with HSRs. HSRs are simply not fast enough\xe2\x80\x94even over links of 250 to 300 miles or so, their generally claimed optimal range\xe2\x80\x94to make one-stop rail trips of about 500 miles attractive. Thus, although many national HSR systems have centroids, they seldom serve the same sort of hubbing functions found with traditional airlines. Rather, they  10.

THE MAIN HSR SYSTEMS As stated previously, China, Japan, and Spain have the three largest HSR systems by network length, although not by patronage. The three systems differ, however, in form and in their economics.  Japan The Japanese Shinkansen system established the modern approach to highspeed rail. With some 45 million people living in the densely populated Tokyoto-Osaka corridor, congestion on roads and railways became a serious problem after World War II, and the government began considering a new HSR service. Japan in the 1950s was a populous, resource-limited nation that\xe2\x80\x94for security and economic reasons\xe2\x80\x94did not want to import petroleum but needed a way to transport its millions of people between its largest cities. The country also was reluctant to give any indication that it was trying to develop military air power by building up its domestic airlines. The original Japanese railways generally used narrow-gauge rails, but the increased stability offered by widening the rails to standard gauge promised to make very high-speed rail travel much simpler; thus standard-gauge rail was adopted for high-speed services. The Shinkansen service would provide a new alignment, 25-percent wider standard gauge, continuously welded rails between Tokyo and Osaka using rolling stock designed for 155 mph (although limited initially to 130 mph for safety reasons). It also would be built in a corridor of a length and terrain highly suited to HSR. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s first HSR system, the T\xc5\x8dkaid\xc5\x8d Shinkansen, was opened in time for the 1964 Olympic Games. Within three years, more than 100 million passengers had used the trains, and the HSR system reached the milestone of its first billion passengers in 1976.11 In 1972, the line was extended 100 miles, and further construction resulted in the system\xe2\x80\x99s expanding to 1,626 miles by 2015, with a further 341 miles of extensions currently under construction and due to open in stages between March 2016 and 2035 (table 1). The cumulative patronage on the entire system since 1964 is  11. A billion is measured throughout on the short scale, as used by the United States (that is, 109), not the long scale (1012) used by most of the rest of the world on the metric system.

Since their introduction, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Shinkansen lines have been undergoing constant improvement that has increased not only the lines\xe2\x80\x99 speeds but also their length. More than a dozen train models have been produced, addressing diverse issues such as tunnel boom noise, vibration, aerodynamic drag, lines with lower patronage (\xe2\x80\x9cMini Shinkansen\xe2\x80\x9d), earthquake and typhoon safety, braking distance, problems resulting from snow, and energy consumption (newer trains are twice as energy efficient as the initial ones despite traveling at greater speeds). In an effort to enhance efficiency, in 1987 Japan\xe2\x80\x99s national railways were divided and privatized into seven for-profit companies (one being freight only). JR East, the largest by passenger numbers, does not require any public subsidy from the Japanese government. One reason for its efficiency is that JR East owns all the infrastructure on the route\xe2\x80\x94the stations, the rolling stock, and the tracks\xe2\x80\x94meaning that fewer management teams duplicate work. The railway also thrives because of a planning system that encourages the building of commercial developments and housing alongside the railway route. JR East owns the land around the railways and leases it; nearly one-third of its revenue comes from shopping malls, blocks of offices, flats, and the like. Geography has influenced the rail system\xe2\x80\x99s development: most of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s 128 million inhabitants live in a few densely populated cities along the country\xe2\x80\x99s coastline. By linking those dense populations together\xe2\x80\x94nearly 40 million people in greater Tokyo with the 20 million residents of Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto\xe2\x80\x94the railway helped to shift business patterns, making day trips between Tokyo and Osaka possible. From a purely practical perspective, other modes could likely not handle the sheer volume of traffic on the Tokyo\xe2\x80\x93Osaka corridor. Many HSR  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  14  customers also are from higher income brackets and are willing to pay for more expensive high-speed tickets rather than use road alternatives.  Spain Supported by European Union (EU) and national subsidies, by 2015, Europe had added more than 3,700 miles of HSR track to the 620 miles that existed in 1990, and more construction is planned. For example, by 2017, no fewer than four new French lines will begin operations. The EU also intends to finance a $5.3 billion HSR link between Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Against that background, the Spanish HSR system has developed. In 1992, and in time for the Barcelona Olympic Games and Seville Expo \xe2\x80\x9992, the Madrid\xe2\x80\x93Seville high-speed rail line opened. The Alta Velocidad Espa\xc3\xb1ola (AVE) system has subsequently been developed rapidly, with financial support from the EU. Its construction has coincided with periods of serious economic crisis, with some potential interaction between the two.12 The Madrid-centric system grew rapidly in the early years of the 21st century (table 2), and in 2005, the Spanish government announced policy plans that by 2020, 90 percent of the population of the country would be living within 30 miles of an AVE station, irrespective of the costs or economic returns. As of 2015, the AVE had reached 1,900 miles and is now the largest system in Europe, surpassed globally only by China\xe2\x80\x99s. Traffic on Spain\xe2\x80\x99s HSR falls well short of the volume on other major HSR systems; it is only about 5 percent of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s and 10 percent of France\xe2\x80\x99s. To become the world\xe2\x80\x99s second longest system, Spain has invested more than $50 billion in completed infrastructure and has allocated $1.5 billion more to lines currently under construction. That is about 4 percent of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s GDP, although about $11 billion has been funded over the years by grants from the European Union, and even more has been obtained by soft loans through different transfer programs. In relative terms, consulting firm A.T. Kearney found Spain\xe2\x80\x99s HSR to be a cheap HSR system, costing about $9.5 million per mile\xe2\x80\x94a cost comparable  12.

Although EU funding may be seen as an external subsidy, Spain is the fourth largest economy in the Union, thus part of the funding is de facto a transfer of Spanish funds back to Spain.

In 2005, various parties agreed to invest in an HSR service between Perpignan in France and Figueres in Spain. It was financed with $700 million in tax funds from the governments and the EU, with the balance of $500 million as loans from a group of Spanish banks. TP Ferro, involving Eiffage (France) and ACS (Spain), was awarded a 53-year concession to build and operate the infrastructure and to be paid fees for its use. Service began in 2009, but the forecast traffic of 19,000 trains per year had reached only 800 by 2015. Receivers were called in September 2015 when debt to the banks could not be met. The two governments will take over the bankrupt project company, 13. A.T. Kearney, \xe2\x80\x9cContribuci\xc3\xb3n de las infraestructuras al desarrollo econ\xc3\xb3mico y social de Espa\xc3\xb1a,\xe2\x80\x9d September 2015.  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  16  assume responsibility for paying the bank loans, and operate it as a binational government enterprise. The motivations underlying the development of an HSR system in Spain seem to have little do with mobility or economic development and more to do with solidifying the political power of Madrid, from which the main lines radiate.14 Linked to that motivation, the system also serves all the regional capitals, irrespective of their population size. Indeed, there is little evidence that any benefit-cost calculations\xe2\x80\x94even in the broadest sense\xe2\x80\x94were being conducted regarding the development effects of the system.  China The Chinese \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic miracle\xe2\x80\x9d is generally traced to the economic reforms of 1978 that allowed more market-based activities in the country.15 State planning for HSR began in the early 1990s, and the first line, the Qinhuangdao\xe2\x80\x93Shenyang Passenger Railway, opened in 2003. By 2008, high-speed trains were running at up to 217 mph between Beijing and Tianjin as part of the infrastructure development of the Beijing Summer Olympic Games, and in 2009, trains on the new Wuhan\xe2\x80\x93Guangzhou High-Speed Railway set a world record average speed of 194.2 mph for the 601-mile trip. A collision of high-speed trains in July 2011 in eastern China, which killed 40 people and injured 195, raised concerns about safety, and a financial crisis later in the year slowed the construction of new lines. By 2012, though, the highspeed rail boom had renewed, with new lines and new rolling stock by domestic producers that had indigenized foreign technology. In December 2012, China opened the world\xe2\x80\x99s longest high-speed rail line, which runs 1,372 miles from the country\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Beijing, in the north to Shenzhen on the south coast. China had nearly 12,000 miles of high-speed rail in 2015, or about 65 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s total. The system is still rapidly expanding to create the so-called 4+4 National High Speed Rail Grid, with tentacles spreading away from the south and west to less populated regions in the hinterland of the country. The system is heavily used (table 3), although it is expensive for passengers compared with the much slower, low-fare, conventional rail network. The fares, although low by international standards, are relatively high despite significant 14.

The official line for the capital subsidies is that HSR is a quasi-public good and thus would be undersupplied without appropriate government support. About 40 to 50 percent of the system\xe2\x80\x99s investment financing is provided by the national government through loans from stateowned banks and financial institutions, 40 percent comes from bonds issued by the Ministry of Railway, and the remainder is provided by provincial and local governments. The development of high-speed rail has forced the once highly inefficient domestic airlines in China to slash airfare and cancel regional flights. The effect of high-speed rail on air travel is most acute for intercity trips of less than 310 miles. By 2011, airline service had been halted on previously widely used routes, including Wuhan\xe2\x80\x93Nanjing, Wuhan\xe2\x80\x93Nanchang, Xi\xe2\x80\x99an\xe2\x80\x93Zhengzhou, and Chengdu\xe2\x80\x93Chongqing. Flights on routes of more than 900 miles generally are unaffected by HSR, with competition continuing over intermediate distances. That consequence should be taken in the context of a relatively underdeveloped low-cost carrier airline market in China and subsidized HSR fares.  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES Rail investments are long term, and their implications for economic development are difficult to isolate in a continually changing world. Certainly, in the past skeptics have been unconvinced by the role that railways can play in economic development. Not least of those skeptics was Nobel Prize winner Robert Fogel, who famously said, \xe2\x80\x9cDespite its eventual ubiquity in inland transportation, despite its devouring appetite for capital, despite its power to determine the outcome of commercial (and sometimes political) competition, the railroad did  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  18  TABLE 4.

So even if there were a link between economic growth and rail infrastructure, one could argue that the indicators of that link may take time to emerge. However, if serious potential were associated with HSR, then one would anticipate some positive effect quite quickly. Otherwise, a case for postponement is strong. Academics have generally exhibited a fairly healthy skepticism over many of the ex ante projections regarding the development effects of HSR. In many cases, investments have provided much lower returns than forecast and, often, negative net gains. The doubts of academics concern both the level of development benefits from HSR and its geographical distribution.17 Focusing initially on the costs that users pay for HSR services, table 4 provides some very rough-and-ready computations of the journey times between Spanish airports and between HSR stations and the fares charged. The fare discrimination used by both modes inevitably makes anything but broad comparisons challenging. The HSR routes are selected by design to involve a change of train, vary in length, and have modal competition from low-cost air carriers. In Spain, that represents the reality. The change of train reflects that longer routes, where air services are viable, are not served by direct HSR services. The main competition is between direct air and indirect HSR services. The services listed are one-way, web-cited services accessed on July 17, 2016, for an economy trip on August 16, that begins about 9 a.m. and covers only the air or HSR part of each  16. Robert W. Fogel, Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins Press, 1964). 17. For a broad survey of work in this area, see Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris et al., \xe2\x80\x9cTracks to Change or Mixed Signals?

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  19  trip; the costs and times of access to and egress from terminals are absent. To try to reduce some of the distortions from subsidies, the routes were selected because at least one of the airports on each route is profitable.18 Despite the array of caveats that must surround these data, airlines clearly can be both cheaper and faster between terminals than is HSR, thus any other advantage enjoyed by rail users because of HSR attributes will be relatively small. The implications for that conclusion are that even if HSR has development benefits exceeding those measured as transportation user gains, they will not be of any significant size. Traffic generated by HSR services\xe2\x80\x94traffic important in terms of developing agglomeration economies\xe2\x80\x94has varied in magnitude but often is relatively small. In Japan, for example, 6 percent of the traffic on the Sanyo Shinkansen was newly generated, 55 percent came from other rail lines, 23 percent from air, and 16 percent from intercity bus. In other words, although HSR rail services have attracted new passengers, the diversion from other modes can be substantial. Mode switchers, although enjoying possible transportation benefits, do not produce much in the way of agglomeration economies because they are already making the same journey, and the HSR has no relocation implication for them. Among the limited details we have from China is an assessment of the Nanguang and Guiguang services that began operating in 2014 and that reduced rail travel times between their respective origins and destinations from 13 to 3 hours and from 21 to 4. The assessment found, however, that many of the travelers would have made the journey anyway\xe2\x80\x9464 percent of Guiguang passengers said they would have made the trip anyway, as did 82 percent of Nanguang passengers. Of the newly generated traffic, only 15 percent of travelers using the Guiguang service and 30 percent of those using the Nanguang service were doing so for business.19 In some cases, of course, and for a variety of reasons (such as serious congestion at airports, as with Heathrow, London, or because the routes are suboptimally short for air travel, as with Paris to Brussels), HSR has taken market shares from airlines, although with considerable subsidies. Examples include Madrid\xe2\x80\x93Seville (rail, 83 percent; air, 27 percent), Paris\xe2\x80\x93London (rail, 81 percent;  18. These data clearly omit travel costs and time to and from stations and airports at both ends of the trips. Given the vast diversity of origins and final destinations of trips, to include those data would require large surveys. What is clear is that assuming that HSR has an advantage because its stations often are closer to city centers is far too simplistic. Many jobs and homes are located well away from the city centers, and access to the nearest airport\xe2\x80\x94because traffic is less congested\xe2\x80\x94may be easier than to a city center HSR terminal. 19. Nanyan Zhou et al., High-Speed Railways in China: An Update on Passenger Profiles (World Bank Report 102815, Washington, DC, 2016).  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  20  air, 17 percent), and Paris\xe2\x80\x93Brussels (rail, 95 percent; air, 5 percent). Often, however, HSR simply causes a transfer from traditional railways. Between 2000 and 2011, as high-speed lines opened across the European Union, rail\xe2\x80\x99s overall share of passenger-miles traveled changed little, by 6.4 percent in 2011. Cars\xe2\x80\x99 share had barely changed, at 72.5 percent. Buses lost a percentage point, to 8.2 percent, and airlines, excluding flights to outside the EU, gained more than a point, to 8.9 percent.20 In terms of figure 1, all this would seem to imply that the travelers\xe2\x80\x99 benefits from enhanced transportation on a route, shown on the left-hand side of the figure, are not large; therefore, the wider economic spillover effects to the economy, shown on the right side, are likely to be limited.  THE EFFECTS ON REGIONAL EQUITY High-speed rail projects often run into trouble when they are sold on a promise of promoting regional equity and reducing congestion in what are seen as overheating regions; the term regional rebalancing has become central to the rhetoric associated with that idea. Evidence, however, suggests the opposite can often be true. To quote economist Diego Puga, \xe2\x80\x9cRoad and rail tracks can be used to travel both ways. A better connection between two regions with different development levels not only gives firms in a less developed region better access to the inputs and markets of more developed regions, it also makes it easier for firms in richer regions to supply poorer regions at a distance, and can thus harm the industrialisation prospects of less developed areas.\xe2\x80\x9d21 The Shinkansen system, for example, delivers much of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s workforce to Tokyo, but, as we see later, has done little to spread employment away from the capital. In terms of overall economic growth, evidence from 1997 indicates 20. Economist, \xe2\x80\x9cHigh-Speed Rail in Europe: Problems Down the Line,\xe2\x80\x9d January 10, 2015. 21.

Faster growth happened, therefore, where it was already expected even before the line was planned or built. When the Paris-to-Rhone Alps line was introduced to France\xe2\x80\x99s TGV system, train travel to Paris increased by 144 percent in terms of the base of the travelers, but travel in the opposite direction grew by only 54 percent. The projection had been that the rail line would lead to a dispersion of economic activity away from the heavily congested \xc3\x8ele-de-France. The situation was summed up by John Tomaney in evidence he gave to the UK House of Commons relating to the idea of investing in more HSR in the UK: \xe2\x80\x9cFollowing our review of the international peer-reviewed and other literature . . . there are compelling reasons to doubt whether HSR will contribute to \xe2\x80\x98rebalancing regional economies.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d23 From an ex ante assessment perspective, much of the excessive optimism that has accompanied many infrastructure projects seems to have come from a combination of serious underestimation of the final financial costs and serious overoptimism concerning the ultimate use. Although those issues are found across the board in transportation analysis, the assessment of fixed track infrastructure, including HSR, is particularly prone to flawed estimations.24 The reasons, although partly a reflection of the technical challenges of economic forecasting in general, also seem to be the result of political bias favoring high-profile, high-cost projects, with rail projects having a particular appeal to decision makers. From the macroeconomic perspective, the economic effects are difficult to isolate but include the following: First, HSR is a small element of any overall economy or, indeed, any national transportation system. Second, HSR rail investments, and thus their effects, appear over a number of years. Third, the counterfactual of not having HSR is difficult to define, let alone estimate. Fourth, the quality of management of HSR systems varies. Finally, the demands for transportation and its characteristics continually change.  22.

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  22  From a policy perspective, if the aim is to aid slower-growing, lowerincome regions, then the best approach in many cases would be to focus on factors other than good-quality access. In the wider European context, and echoing Puga, Andr\xc3\xa9s Rodr\xc3\xadguez-Pose and Ugo Fratesi argue, Since . . . roads, railways, and telecommunication systems run in two directions, a strategy strongly skewed towards specific regional characteristics that are at the root of the development of infrastructure in regions with relatively vulnerable local production structures, weak entrepreneurship levels and technological base, and an often weaker human capital endowment, may solve an important development bottleneck and reduce the infrastructural gap with the rest of the EU, but may leave these regions more exposed to competition from stronger and more technologically advanced firms in core areas. Spain provides an example of where this mechanism may already be at work. The large amount of recent investment in transport infrastructure in Objective 1 regions devoted to the construction of road and high-speed rail links between the periphery of the country and Madrid has probably helped to boost the phenomenal growth rates that Madrid has experienced in the second half of the 1990s. But it has also left many of the Objective 1 regions, whose economic prospects rail-links were supposed to increase, struggling to catch-up.25  GEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The low-flying Airbus effect of HSR lines on the spread of the economic success noted earlier is clear from the experiences of HSR in the three countries examined. Basically, cities not served by HSR, or those served by HSR but peripheral to central cities, will usually gain no significant benefits from HSR. That picture is fairly clear from the experiences of Japan. For example, Robert Cervero found that although the Tokyo\xe2\x80\x93Osaka Shinkansan line had limited effects for employment and job movement, it did strengthen the relative economic positions of Tokyo  25. Andr\xc3\xa9s Rodr\xc3\xadguez-Pose and Ugo Fratesi, \xe2\x80\x9cBetween Development and Social Policies: The Impact of European Structural Funds in Objective 1 Regions,\xe2\x80\x9d Regional Studies 38 (2004): 97\xe2\x80\x93113. The European Union has three categories of regions, of which currently \xe2\x80\x9cless developed regions\xe2\x80\x9d receive the highest level of assistance; those areas were called Objective 1 regions in 2004.  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  23  and Osaka while weakening those of cities not served by HSR.26 In a similar vein, Piet Rietveld and associates find that cities with Shinkansen services have enjoyed faster employment growth than those without, while Kingsley Haynes refines that view to show that employment growth in retail, industrial construction, and wholesale grew by 16 to 34 percent more than in other Japanese cities.27 In line with the work of Sasaki and his colleagues, cited earlier, a World Bank study found that the Japanese Shinkansen network expansion led to a limited degree of regional dispersion from developed to poorer regions. In other words, HSR has not resolved the problem of excessive agglomeration around Tokyo.28 The problem is that, at best, only a small amount of dispersion was likely to result in Japan from its extensive HSR system. The extant local lines were working to the advantage of the more developed regions, and construction of new HSR lines from remote regions improved accessibility only to those local networks, thus adding to the already developed central regions. The outcome is akin to the \xe2\x80\x9cAppalachian Effect\xe2\x80\x9d experiences in the United States in the 1960s, when the economy of the depressed Appalachian region actually suffered by being more closely tied to the rest of the economy after extensive road infrastructure investment.29 Turning to Spain, the situation is similar, with the large cities served by HSR benefiting, although in Spain, more attention has been paid to both complementary investments to HSR and the implications for the economies of large intermediate cities that also enjoy HSR services.30 At the meso level, cities with vacant or poorly utilized land around railway stations have sought to attract HSR services for local redevelopment reasons, as, for example, is the case in Ciudad Real. That situation 26.

Equally, costs are involved in downgrading or closing other stations that become redundant as HSR takes traffic away from local trains. That can reduce the economic growth potential of communities where local services are reduced or lost entirely.31 Intermediate, second-tier cities in Spain on HSR lines, especially those within about 125 miles of a primary terminal\xe2\x80\x94most notably, Madrid\xe2\x80\x94have benefited. Although commuting is two way, the benefit has largely been in terms of land-use values (that are largely captured in HSR user benefits) and more refined labor markets given that those services facilitate one-hour commutes between the urban areas. As a benchmark, the average commute for residents of Madrid is 32 minutes, although the number of workers with longer commutes has been increasing. The intermediate stops on longer HSR routes, however, lengthen overall travel times for long-distance travelers. In terms of specific industries that also tend to be geographically concentrated, the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 World Tourism Organization found that the 65 million visitors to Spain in 2014 made the country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign tourist industry the third largest in the world, with the second largest amount of financial receipts ($65.4 billion, or about 11 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s GDP). Daniel Albalate and Xavier Fagedata, using data covering 50 Spanish provinces between 1998 and 2013, provide mixed evidence about the effect of HSR on the sector.32 Air transportation, the main mode for long-distance tourist mobility and a strong predictor of tourists traveling to Spain, is clearly negatively affected by HSR on continental European routes.33 However, HSR has a very weak positive direct effect on tourism within the country, although that effect is influenced by the measure of HSR accessibility adopted and the type of analysis used.  WHAT ABOUT THE COSTS? Most studies of the economic growth implications of HSR focus largely on the gross, direct development effects and say little about the long- and short-term  31.

Further, the matter of the broader opportunity costs involved in taking resources from elsewhere to fund HSR services is almost universally neglected. Indeed, that omission is somewhat ironic because one of the oft-cited justifications for public-sector engagement is that HSR, because of market imperfections, will be underprovided in the marketplace. Stepping aside from the rather unclear picture of the environmental cost of HSR, the financial costs almost inevitably are very much higher than often claimed, and revenues less. Indeed, that is one reason HSR services such as between Shanghai and Nanjing, which opened in 2009, closed after 10 days; the Toledo\xe2\x80\x93Cuenca\xe2\x80\x93Albecete service in Spain closed in 2011 after having far fewer than 3,000 passengers in six months; and, more recently, as mentioned previously, the Perpignan\xe2\x80\x93Figueres service went into receivership in 2016. HSR accounting can be creative and fuzzy, but HSRs are generally accepted to be expensive to construct and to operate, although precise and complete data are hard to come by.34 For example, the current 1,900-mile Spanish system has cost an estimated $44 billion to build and receives significant annual subsidies of between $330 million and $440 million a year. It also has enjoyed financial aid from the European Union; for example, Spain\xe2\x80\x99s HSR system received $8.2 billion from the European Union in 2010.35 HSR costs also vary considerably by country and by individual project. The average infrastructure unit price of HSR in Europe is, for example, between $17 million and $24 million per mile, and the estimated cost for proposed HSRs in California is, conservatively, $35 million per mile, whereas China\xe2\x80\x99s investments per mile have cost between $11 million and $13 million.36 China\xe2\x80\x99s considerably lower cost per mile is largely due to low land and labor costs, and it is one explanation for the rapid creation of the Chinese system. HSRs also are not very good generators of revenue. Again focusing on Spain, a 2015 report from the Applied Economy Studies Foundation argued that \xe2\x80\x9cnot one of the [country\xe2\x80\x99s high-speed lines] should have been built.\xe2\x80\x9d37 None of them were found to be making a profit; for example, using 50 years of projected financing data to allow for commercial rates of interest on capital costs to be  34.

Economic viability of HSR services and, to a large extent, their development effects depend very much on the density of traffic they carry\xe2\x80\x94basically, the economies of density that can be generated. In that sense, the Japanese system clearly is largely efficient; at the other extreme, the Spanish system probably is not. Considering one million passengers per mile as a measure of traffic density, the Spanish system in 2007 had a density of only 1.7 and in 2008 of 3.44, compared with the European Union average of 15.41 and 16.22 for those years, respectively (France had a density of 25.62 and 28.08 and Germany of 17.06 and 18.16).40 In its two years of operation, the Beijing\xe2\x80\x93Tianjin Intercity Railway in China delivered more than 41 million rides but at a high cost. The line cost more than $3 billion to build and involves $270 million in annual operating costs, including $90 million in interest on its $1.5 billion of loans. In 2008, its first year of operation, the line carried 18.7 million riders and generated $165 million in revenues, a loss of $105 million, and in the second year it carried 22.3 million passengers, reducing losses to $75 million. On that basis, and because of the fare strategy being adopted, the rail line would have to carry 33 million riders a year to recover costs. That volume of traffic is not likely to occur in many places outside China and is considered in the context of China\xe2\x80\x99s construction costs, which are on the lower end of the scale.  38. An earlier indication of the financial and ridership challenges of AVE appeared when, in 1992, after the Olympics, fare reductions of 30 percent on the Madrid\xe2\x80\x93Seville line and 50 percent on the Madrid\xe2\x80\x93Ciudad line were initiated to attract traffic. Those price reductions increased ridership, but the elasticities of demand did little for the financial situation; see Gin\xc3\xa9s de Rus and Christopher Nash, \xe2\x80\x9cIn What Circumstances Is Investing in HSR Worthwhile?\xe2\x80\x9d (Working Paper 8044, Institute of Transport Studies, Leeds, UK), 580. 39. Many of the subsidized airports are small but provide a competitive mode to HSR. The economic problem is that having the HSR system not cover its costs and the airports largely in the same position results in significant overcapacity in the overall Spanish passenger interurban transportation system. The problem seems to be exacerbated by inefficiencies in the system operations. 40.

Jos\xc3\xa9 M. de Ure\xc3\xb1a (Farmham, Surrey, UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2012).  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  27  The Japanese HSR system was initially funded with World Bank assistance (7.5 percent of the construction cost of the Tokaido Shinkansen being a loan). Subsequently, finance came in the form of public-private partnerships after the corporatization of the Japanese rail system in 1987. For example, the Yamagata and Akita Shinkansen infrastructure was 20 percent financed by the central government, 40 percent by local governments, and the remainder by JR East Rail Company. The substantial traffic volumes enjoyed by the Shinkansen suggests that, although only the Tokyo\xe2\x80\x93Osaka line more than covers its full costs (including interest payments on capital, amounting to about 25 percent of costs) and although the Hakata\xe2\x80\x93Osaka line breaks even, many of the other services could likely do so with pricing targeted to that objective. The ability to build large developments alongside the high-speed railways has also been of financial advantage to the Japanese HSR lines, as is the ability to charge high ticket prices in markets where, until recently, low-cost airline competition had been limited.41 Even so, 71 percent of the revenue from passenger tickets at JR East comes from the conventional, slower railway, the less glamorous side of the company\xe2\x80\x99s business. Overall, while there may be arguments that there are economic development effects that exceed user benefits, there are equally important arguments that the costs of HSR exceed those directly attributed to HSR. Furthermore, these latter costs are inevitably higher than those forecast when initially planning any HSR line. No consensus exists, however, on the ratio of the total economic to narrower transportation user benefits of HSR investments, and they are, in any case, inevitably case specific. Appraisals of transportation investments that have, in general, produced ratios as low as 1.25 and as high as 1.6 are of little use in the HSR debates because of the specificity of each HSR service and the peculiarities of the mode in general. One of the problems with HSR systems is the lack of incentive for them to minimize their costs. Lack of competition both within the HSR industry and between it and other modes of transportation contributes to that lack of incentive. Part of the cause is institutional. In Europe, the EU has had difficulty transforming the established national rail monopolies into a pan-European market, with operators competing across borders. The reforms to date have often seen national railways preferring to collaborate than to compete\xe2\x80\x94for example,  41.Changmin Jiang and Xiaoyu Li, \xe2\x80\x9cLow Cost Carrier and High-Speed Rail: A Macroeconomic Comparison between Japan and Western Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d Research in Transportation Business & Management 21 (2016): 3\xe2\x80\x9310.

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  28  France\xe2\x80\x99s SNCF and Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Deutsche Bahn joint venture, Alleo. On a few of the busiest routes, competition may, however, be emerging; for example, Deutsche Bahn has gradually pulled out of Thalys, a venture with SNCF and its Belgian and Dutch counterparts, intending to compete with it. Competition is also gradually appearing in domestic markets. For example, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s first private HSR operator, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori (NTV), started services in 2012 and, although struggling to compete with the indirectly state-owned HSR incumbent, Trenitalia, has more than 20 percent of the market. In 2015, NTV carried 9.1 million passengers, with a load factor of 71.5 percent on 56 daily trains. Competition from other forms of transport is also growing. Lowcost airlines are continuing to expand, and in parts of Europe, the long-distance coach market is being liberalized. Germany opened up its coach market in 2013; consequently, Deutsche Bahn estimated that it lost $55 million in revenues in the first half of 2014.42  SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS Inevitably, attempts are made to transfer previous experiences from other locations to situations nearer home, and that has been an element of the US deliberations over HSR investment. In many cases, this transfer has brought forward useful insights. That high-speed railways can, when the economic and geographical conditions are correct, serve an important economic and social function is undoubtedly true. Ample evidence from experiences outside the United States, however, also reveals many instances of \xe2\x80\x9cirrational exuberance,\xe2\x80\x9d to borrow former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan\xe2\x80\x99s phrase, to direct resources to railways according to the misguided perspective that economic development automatically follows. The provision of HSR investment is, in fact, neither a necessary nor a sufficient input for economic development in many cases and, indeed, is largely a consumer good rather than an intermediate good. The experiences of China, Japan, and Spain indicate that HSR infrastructure can prove far more expensive to construct than suggested in ex ante, quasipolitical analysis and that ridership, combined with that national economic development, can prove to be disappointing at fares even remotely close to cost recovery. If the objective is less that of national economic development and more that of spreading economic activities from congested regions, the results have 42. For a general discussion of HSR-bus competition in Germany, see Katrin Augustin, \xe2\x80\x9cContestability of the German Long-Distance Coach Market\xe2\x80\x9d (paper presented at the European Transport Conference, Frankfurt, Germany, September 2013).  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  29  also generally been disappointing. HSR provides two-way services, and the tendency has been for its introduction to lead to more longer-distance commuting to and from established economic centers rather than to the geographical spread of employment and production. Although exceptions exist, most locations along an HSR line enjoy little economic stimulus from their situation and, indeed, may have some economic vitality drained from them by cities at or near the main stations. Even the those cities, however, often require significant, generally publicly funded, supplementary investment to facilitate access to HSR and to take advantage of any potential local agglomeration economies. Such supplementary outlays add to the overall costs of any HSR line but are not typically included in the costs of the HSR system. They are, however, part of the overall HSR infrastructure, being highly complementary to it, and de facto a joint cost involved in any economic development that takes place. Limitations also emerge when looking at the experiences of the three largest HSR systems and in trying to transfer those experiences elsewhere, and this paper has mentioned many of those limitations. Added to the list is the retrospective nature of looking at what has been done to date when, often, public and political policy\xe2\x80\x94rather than strict economic development considerations\xe2\x80\x94 dominated. Given rising populations, the ongoing global urbanization process, the growth of megacities, and increased internationalization, a future need for more high-capacity and faster long-distance transportation seems inevitable if economic growth is to continue. Within the right context, HSR has a clear contribution to make. With advanced air traffic control systems, new airline technologies, and innovative management, aviation may also partially fill that role, and, indeed, that sector has proved ingenious at contributing in the past when not overburdened with economic regulation. In densely trafficked corridors, however, aviation has its limitations. HSR, as its technology is further refined, can serve that role, but the challenge for it to do so is neither economic nor technical but political. The market can provide the guidance, but the main reason HSR has, to date, failed to meet its promise has been because markets have not been allowed to determine the initial allocation of resources. Also, once constructed, HSR has too often been managed and priced as a vehicle of political integration rather than one of economic development.

Advocates argue that HSR can provide important stimuli to the national and select regional economies. While this argument is difficult to assess in the abstract, policymakers can gain insight by looking at HSR systems outside the United States. In \xe2\x80\x9cHigh-Speed Railways: Do they Produce Economic Growth?,\xe2\x80\x9d transportation economist Kenneth Button examines the broad effects HSR systems have had on macroeconomic development in Japan, Spain, and China. He also explores these systems\xe2\x80\x99 more localized, regional implications. The study shows that the results of HSR\xe2\x80\x99s introduction were generally disappointing: governments have faced problems recovering the cost of construction, and the systems have largely failed to spread employment and economic growth away from cities. THE NATURE OF HIGH-SPEED RAILWAYS All three HSR systems use modern information systems to monitor and control operations and to refine prices in order to achieve revenue targets. However, the systems in Japan, Spain, and China differ greatly regarding their geography, history, economics, and political priorities. Japan Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Shinkansen system, adopted to combat post\xe2\x80\x93World War II congestion problems, developed the modern approach to HSR. The Shinkansen lines, now many decades old, have gone through various innovations over time. Their development has been influenced by (1) Japan\xe2\x80\x99s geography, dominated by densely populated coastal cities, and (2) technological progress. Spain The first HSR system in Spain was unveiled in 1992 for the Barcelona Olympic Games and the Seville Expo \xe2\x80\x9992. It rapidly expanded at the beginning of the 21st century, and by 2015 the system became the world\xe2\x80\x99s second longest. Spain\xe2\x80\x99s HSR system is also relatively cheap, costing about $9.5 million per  mile (compared to Japan\xe2\x80\x99s $33.5 million per mile and Germany\xe2\x80\x99s $15 million per mile), but it has been supported by large subsidies. Traffic on Spain\xe2\x80\x99s system falls well below that of other HSR systems: it is about 5 percent as heavy as Japan\xe2\x80\x99s and about 10 percent as heavy as France\xe2\x80\x99s. The system serves all the regional capitals equally regardless of their population size, solidifying political power in Madrid at the center. China China\xe2\x80\x99s HSR system is heavily used (it had roughly 893 million users in 2014) and fares are much higher than fares for the country\xe2\x80\x99s conventional railways. After a brief slump in both use and construction in 2011, 2012 saw a boom in HSR use. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES Economic development outcomes are extremely difficult to assess, especially in a changing world. In terms of costs paid by Spanish HSR users, it helps to compare journey times and fares for similar trips between airports and between HSR stations. HSR routes used in this comparison are purposely selected to involve a change of train, vary in length, and have modal competition from lowcost air carriers. Table 1 shows the comparative costs. Table 1.

In Spain, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that airlines can be both cheaper and faster between terminals than HSR; thus any other advantages that passengers of HSR gain are relatively small. However, in some cases\xe2\x80\x94for example, when there is congestion at the airports or when routes are suboptimally short for air travel\xe2\x80\x94HSR is more attractive than air travel. DOES IT PAY TO UTILIZE HSR? The costs of subsidized investment in, operations of, and maintenance on HSR systems are very much higher than often claimed, while revenues are often lower. Effects on regional equity and growth vary. \xe2\x80\xa2  HSR has failed to spread employment in Japan. The Shinkansen system does little to spread employment away from Tokyo. Although Japanese cities that have HSR connections have grown faster than those that do not, the HSR system was designed to serve areas where  2  economic growth was expected before the planning or building of the Shinkansen system, so it is not clear that this growth is related to HSR. \xe2\x80\xa2  HSR has not generated much revenue in Spain. A 2015 report from the Applied Economy Studies Foundation found that none of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s HSR lines were making an operating profit. The financial problems of the system have been exacerbated by wider macroeconomic and transportation conditions.  \xe2\x80\xa2  However, the Japanese system is very efficient at moving large numbers of people. The abilities to build large developments alongside the high-speed railways, charge high ticket prices, and (until recently) limit competition from low-cost air travel have been financial advantages to parts of the Japanese system.  CONCLUSION The experiences of Japan, Spain, and China show that HSR infrastructure can prove far more expensive than political leadership suggests before construction. Additionally, ridership and national economic development can prove disappointing when fares do not come close to covering costs. If the objective is to spread economic activity away from congested regions, the results also prove disappointing. HSR\xe2\x80\x99s introduction has tended to encourage longer-distance commuting to and from established economic centers rather than the geographical dispersion of employment and production.  3  ' https://www.mercatus.org/publications/high-speed-railways-economic-growth
