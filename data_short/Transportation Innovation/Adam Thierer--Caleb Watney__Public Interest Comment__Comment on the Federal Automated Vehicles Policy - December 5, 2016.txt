 b'Bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems  PUBLIC INTEREST COMMENT  COMMENT ON THE FEDERAL AUTOMATED VEHICLES POLICY ADAM THIERER Senior Research Fellow, Technology Policy Program Mercatus Center at George Mason University CALEB WATNEY MA Fellow Mercatus Center at George Mason University Request for Comment on Federal Automated Vehicles Policy Agency: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Transportation Proposed: September 23, 2016 Comment period closes: November 22, 2016 Submitted: November 22, 2016 Docket ID: NHTSA-2016-0090  INTRODUCTION The Technology Policy Program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University is dedicated to advancing knowledge about the effects of regulation on society. As part of its mission, the program conducts independent analyses to assess agency rulemakings and proposals from the perspective of consumers and the public. Therefore, this reply comment does not represent the views of any particular affected party but is designed to assist the agency as it explores these issues.  For more information, contact Taylor Barkley, Assistant Director of Outreach for Technology Policy 703-993-8205, tbarkley@mercatus.gmu.edu Mercatus Center at George Mason University 3434 Washington Boulevard, 4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22201  We appreciate the opportunity to submit reply comments regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NHTSA) Federal Automated Vehicles Policy.1 We are also grateful to our Mercatus colleague Oliver Sherouse for his valuable help in the construction of our regulatory delay model.  THE BASELINE IN THE DEBATE OVER AUTOMATED VEHICLE POLICY \xe2\x80\x9cEvery single death on our roadways is a tragedy,\xe2\x80\x9d NHTSA administrator Mark Rosekind noted recently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can prevent them. Our drive toward zero deaths is more than just a worthy goal. It is the only acceptable goal.\xe2\x80\x9d2 We agree. Zero fatalities on our roads is a noble goal. But the length of time it takes to reach that goal is just as important as the goal itself. We are concerned that NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s proposed policy for automated vehicles may inadvertently increase the number of total automobile fatalities by delaying the rapid development and diffusion of this life-saving technology. At every juncture of this ongoing debate over highly automated vehicle (HAV) policy, we must keep in mind the real-world baseline of motor vehicle safety. As NHTSA knows all too well, the current baseline is troubling, with over 35,000 people dying on US roadways in 2015 (roughly 96 people per day) and 94 percent of all crashes being attributable to human error. More disturbing is the fact that, as NHTSA recently noted, \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary estimates for the first half of 2016 show an alarming uptick in fatalities\xe2\x80\x94an increase of about 10.4 percent as compared to the number of fatalities in the first half of 2015.\xe2\x80\x9d3 Imagine if everyone who was drunk behind the wheel were instead in the backseat of an HAV. In 2014 nearly 9,100 people were killed in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes (25 people per day), and there was an average of one alcohol-impaired-driving fatality every 53 minutes. And motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people age 16 through 24. It seems reasonable to assume that the majority of these tragedies could be avoided if autonomous systems took over the job of driving for us.4 For these reasons, some have pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9cautomation on the roads could be the great public-health achievement of the 21st century\xe2\x80\x9d if HAV technology can help address this situation and move us closer to a world of zero fatalities.5 Every policy decision must be judged 1.

It has no emotions. So once you train and test the car, it gets better and better as more and more experiences accumulate.\xe2\x80\x9d Jen-Hsun Huang, interview by Jason Anders, \xe2\x80\x9cInside the Brain of the Driverless Car,\xe2\x80\x9d Wall Street Journal, October 30, 2016. 5.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  2  by how rapidly it can help us advance that goal and move us away from the current baseline in terms of both lives lost and other costs to citizens and the economy. Indeed, the toll in terms of human lives is not the end of the story. The estimated economic cost of all motor vehicle traffic crashes in the United States in 2010 (the most recent year for which cost data is available) was $242 billion.6 Lowering the frequency of accidents will, therefore, have many beneficial effects on the economy. If HAV technology eliminates the need for households to own vehicles altogether, the economic implications will be profound for a typical family. In his recent book, Humans Need Not Apply, computer scientist Jerry Kaplan observes that, with the average car costing owners $9,151 per year to drive 15,000 miles (2013 data) and with most households owning two cars, American households spend $18,000 annually on their vehicles.7 Because driverless cars will help bring down transportation costs, and because fewer Americans may need to own cars at all, Kaplan estimates a potential 75 percent drop in the cost of personal transportation\xe2\x80\x94a savings roughly equal to a typical family\xe2\x80\x99s entire annual food budget.8 The NHTSA should keep these numbers in mind as it contemplates public policy for HAVs. Any policy that would slow HAV innovation would likely have profoundly deleterious implications for society.  THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR RESTRAINT In this section, we identify the most worrisome portion of the NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s proposed HAV guidance: the agency\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that some sort of premarket approval authority might be needed for these technologies. Generally speaking, wise policy that encourages innovation avoids prior restraints on trialand-error experimentation. Prior regulatory restraints on innovative activities stifle the sort of creative, organic, bottom-up solutions that will be needed to solve problems that may be unforeseeable today.9 Attempting to preemptively plan for every hypothetical worst-case scenario and then requiring it to be addressed through a regulatory process means that many best-case scenarios will never come about.10 When commercial uses of an important resource or technology are arbitrarily prohibited or curtailed, the opportunity costs of such exclusion may not always be immediately evident. Nonetheless, those unseen effects are very real and have profound consequences for individuals, the 6.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  3  economy, and society. The Internet itself provides a good example of the profound opportunity costs associated with misguided regulation. Initially, commercial development of the Internet was prohibited. But when this mistake was corrected in the early 1990s through the commercial opening of the Internet, the true opportunity costs of the original prohibitions become evident. E-commerce exploded following commercialization, and a vibrant array of new sites and services emerged rapidly\xe2\x80\x94and in ways that no one could have predicted just a few years earlier. New and better digital services continue to emerge rapidly thanks to America\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpermissionless innovation\xe2\x80\x9d approach to Internet policy.11 This is why NHTSA should keep opportunity costs in mind as the agency looks to formulate policy for a fast-moving technology like HAVs. This principle is particularly true in the case of HAVs because the opportunity costs include human lives. If policymakers discount unseen potential future gains or opportunities of HAVs and focus only on the immediate potential risks\xe2\x80\x94and then impose prior regulatory restraints to deal with them\xe2\x80\x94the costs could be catastrophic in terms of human life. It is helpful to think about this issue in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cerror costs,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a term that antitrust lawyers and economists use when referring to the costs of bad decisions about innovation and competition policy.12 These scholars are concerned with two types of errors: Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors. Type I and Type II errors are not equivalent because \xe2\x80\x9cfalse positives are more costly than false negatives, because self-correction mechanisms mitigate the latter but not the former.\xe2\x80\x9d13 Stated differently, \xe2\x80\x9cin the second (Type II error) case, society can witness the effects of the technology\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cin the first (Type I error) case, consumers will never know what they are missing,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Michael A. Carrier of Rutgers Law School.14 \xe2\x80\x9cWe can only see the tip of the innovation iceberg, and a technology\xe2\x80\x99s abandonment will forever deny consumer its possibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d he argues. \xe2\x80\x9cThe error-cost asymmetry is another reason for erring on the side of not quashing the technology.\xe2\x80\x9d15 Error-cost analysis provides a useful framework for exploring innovation policy issues and explains why NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of premarket approval authority is so troubling. Beginning on page 71 of the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, NHTSA suggests, A pre-market approval approach\xe2\x80\x94used either in conjunction with or as a replacement for DOT\xe2\x80\x99s existing self-certification and compliance testing process\xe2\x80\x94might have potential for expediting the safe introduction and public acceptance of HAVs. Such a regulatory approach could also contribute to public acceptance 11. Adam Thierer, \xe2\x80\x9cEmbracing a Culture of Permissionless Innovation,\xe2\x80\x9d Cato Online Forum, November 2014. 12.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  4  of and confidence in HAVs, because it would involve affirmative approval by the federal government of the safety of HAVs and new safety technologies.16 More specifically, NHTSA adoption of a full pre-market approval approach for HAVs would entail replacing the self-certification process with at least two new statutory provisions. The first provision would prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, offer for sale and sale of HAVs unless, prior to such actions, NHTSA has assessed the safety of the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s performance and approved the vehicle.17 NHTSA admits that \xe2\x80\x9csubstitution of pre-market approval for all standards for which manufacturers currently self-certify would be a wholesale structural change in the way NHTSA regulates motor vehicle safety and would require both fundamental statutory changes and a large increase in Agency resources.\xe2\x80\x9d18 The agency also suggests that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) might provide a model for how such premarket approval of HAVs by NHTSA could work.19 However, in a short appendix to its HAV guidance document, NHTSA notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe duration of the [FAA] certification processes varies. Typically, they last three to five years.\xe2\x80\x9d20 Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most recent FAA certification process for a new commercial aircraft design, the one for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, lasted considerably longer. It consumed an estimated 200,000 hours of FAA staff time and lasted eight years.\xe2\x80\x9d21 That fact alone should foreclose any further discussion about the wisdom of NHTSA employing an FAA-like premarket approval regime for HAVs. Even the average duration of FAA premarket certifications (three to five years) is far too long if we hope to get life-saving HAV technologies deployed on a timely basis. One way of comparing the costs of the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s premarket approval regime and NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s current postmarket approval regime is by looking at the cost to produce automobiles versus civilian aircraft over time. If the lengthy premarket approval process used by the FAA significantly increases the time and cost of getting new civilian aircraft onto the market, we would expect that to appear in the long-term costs of production as measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI). While there may be too much noise to pick up a clear trend over a short period of time, the long-term data should reveal any difference between the two regulatory structures.  16.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  5  Figure 1 shows a clear divergence in the cost of producing civilian aircraft22 and automobiles23 since 1985, which is the earliest year data is available for both. After chaining both indices to 1985, we can see that the cost of production has risen 43 percent for automobiles and 167 percent for civilian aircraft over the last 31 years. FIGURE 1. RELATIVE COST TO PRODUCE AUTOMOBILES AND CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT  300  producer price index  250  200 civilian aircraft PPI 150  100  automobile PPI  50  0  1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011  2013 2015  While there are undoubtedly many factors at play in determining the costs of production for both industries, it seems unclear what could cause such a large differential in the costs of production. Some of the potential explanations hold no water. Automobiles and airplanes are made out of similar materials, and while aircraft use much more aluminum than automobiles, the price of aluminum has been relatively stable over the last 30 years.24 The increase in economies of scale should actually benefit aircraft over this period because there has been larger growth in miles flown than miles driven since 1985.25 And by focusing on the cost for producers rather than consumers, we avoid any confounding variables relating to collusion in the airline industry to charge consumers higher prices. Given the lack of other explanations, it seems likely that the large differential must be at least partially attributable to the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s more complicated and time-consuming regulatory approach.  22.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  6  Regulation predicated on premarket approval has real costs to industry that may be too small to measure in any given year but can add up significantly in the long run. There will also be serious costs associated with any attempt to apply traditional vehicle regulatory standards to emerging HAV systems. Paul Brubaker, a former administrator of DOT\xe2\x80\x99s Research and Innovative Technology Administration and the current president and CEO of the Alliance for Transportation Innovation, recently noted that NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s guidance document \xe2\x80\x9cstill requires that autonomous vehicles must demonstrate compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).\xe2\x80\x9d26 Brubaker describes the problem with this requirement: These standards include 286 references to human drivers and mandate traditional design features such as steering wheels, displays and pedals. Any fully self-driving vehicle would violate more than one-third of those standards, not to mention half of the Series 100 Crash Avoidance standards built into the compliance structure.27 \xe2\x80\x9cThis is 2016, not 1966 when the Highway Safety Act that laid out this governance process passed,\xe2\x80\x9d Brubaker notes. \xe2\x80\x9cToday, innovation cycles are measured in months but temporary exceptions can take a year or more and the rulemaking process will take considerably longer.\xe2\x80\x9d 28 Brubaker is correct. It is highly unlikely that regulation will be able to evolve fast enough to make this approach work because of the so-called pacing problem, which refers to the \xe2\x80\x9cthe gap between the introduction of a new technology and the establishment of laws, regulations, and oversight mechanisms for shaping its safe development.\xe2\x80\x9d29 Technology policy expert Larry Downes has shown how lawmaking in the information age is inexorably governed by the \xe2\x80\x9claw of disruption,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally.\xe2\x80\x9d30 \xe2\x80\x9cEmerging technologies change at the speed of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Law,\xe2\x80\x9d Downes notes, \xe2\x80\x9cleaving statutes that try to define them by their technical features quickly out of date.\xe2\x80\x9d31 This is a particular problem in the field of automated systems and machine learning, which are advancing at an astonishing pace.32 Carl Tobias, a product liability law professor at the University of Richmond, comments on self-driving technology: \xe2\x80\x9cTechnology is always running ahead  26.

Second, with AV technologies in particular, their newness and rapid evolution create uncertainty in both rulemaking effects and of the technology itself. Moreover, with rapid technology changes, it can be challenging to prescribe rules that will remain relevant and appropriate through the development process.\xe2\x80\x9d James M. Anderson et al., Autonomous Vehicle Technology: A Guide for Policymakers (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2016), 103.  MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  7  of the law, but in this case, it is running way ahead of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d33 Thus, if HAV innovators must constantly apply for exemptions from older rules or even newer guidelines in order to move forward, life-saving innovation in this sector will stagnate or perhaps even completely derail. For these reasons, NHTSA should abandon the idea of premarket approval as a dangerous prior restraint on HAV innovation\xe2\x80\x94a restraint that would put lives at risk. Instead, the agency should focus on best practices and postmarket oversight with the specific goal of monitoring the marketplace for gross negligence. Of course, this is already the \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory\xe2\x80\x9d model at work in our court system, as will be discussed further below.  ALGORITHMIC REGULATION: AVOIDING A FEDERAL CODE COMMISSION In terms of the dangers of premarket approval, we are also particularly concerned about NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it \xe2\x80\x9chas authority to regulate the safety of software changes provided by manufacturers after a vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s first sale to a consumer\xe2\x80\x9d and the suggestion that the agency \xe2\x80\x9cmay need to develop additional regulatory tools and rules to regulate the certification and compliance verification of such post-sale software updates.\xe2\x80\x9d34 It is unclear whether NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s currently regulatory authority can be read so broadly as to include software changes under its regulatory purview.35 Regardless, such postsale regulation of software changes represents an extension of the sort of prior restraint or premarket approval approach that we diagnosed and critiqued above. Regulation of this sort raises the specter of potentially endless technocratic meddling with the design specifications for future code. For example, NHTSA notes, To address problems and to improve and expand performance capabilities in the coming years, manufacturers and other entities will likely provide software updates for motor vehicles well after they are manufactured and certified. Some of those changes will substantially alter the functions and technical capabilities of those vehicles.36 NHTSA seems to imply that this is a problem when, in reality, it is a benefit. The reality is that there is no such thing as perfectly \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d code, and there is no end point when it comes to security. Rather, security is a dynamic and rapidly evolving process.37 Systems have to be 33.

NHTSA, Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, 76. 35. NHTSA argues that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute underlying the FMVSS provides for manufacturer certification of a motor vehicle prior at the time of its manufacture. Subsequent software updates could affect the basis for that certification. In addition, such updates would themselves constitute new items of motor vehicle equipment, subject to the certification requirement and verification, to the extent there are applicable FMVSS.\xe2\x80\x9d Ibid., 77. But Congress has not yet granted the agency the authority to treat HAV software updates as the equivalent of traditional motor vehicle equipment. 36. Ibid., 76\xe2\x80\x9377. 37.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  8  devised and refined in real time to address vulnerabilities. It is only through ongoing realworld experimentation with actual technologies that we will discover better ways to optimize autonomous technologies for safety, security, privacy, and so on. HAV system are dynamic by design, and any attempt to preemptively limit innovation based on short-term security concerns will, ironically, undermine the longer-term possibility of creating safer and more secure systems. \xe2\x80\x9cDynamic systems are not merely turbulent,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Virginia Postrel, author of The Future and Its Enemies. \xe2\x80\x9cThey respond to the desire for security; they just don\xe2\x80\x99t do it by stopping experimentation.\xe2\x80\x9d38 It also is vital to remember that \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturers have powerful reputational incentives at stake here, which will encourage them to continuously improve the security of their systems.\xe2\x80\x9d39 No automaker wants the bad publicity that accompanies car \xe2\x80\x9chacks\xe2\x80\x9d or deficient code that leads to problematic outcomes. Innovators in this arena have a great incentive to understand and quickly deal with these issues because the future of their companies is at stake. Moreover, it is worth noting that courts and class action lawsuits will quickly enter the picture at the first sign of serious trouble with HAV systems.40 The automotive sector already attracts a disproportionately large amount of litigation activity when compared to other sectors, and that trend is certain to continue. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen confronted with new, often complex, questions involving products liability, courts have generally gotten things right,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Brookings Institution scholar John Villasenor.41 \xe2\x80\x9cProducts liability law has been highly adaptive to the many new technologies that have emerged in recent decades, and it will be quite capable of adapting to emerging autonomous vehicle technologies as the need arises,\xe2\x80\x9d he concludes.42 In sum, there is no reason to believe that common law will not adapt to new technological realities, especially since firms have powerful incentives to improve the security of their systems and avoid punishing liability, unwanted press attention, and lost customers. These facts counsel patience by policymakers, rejection of prior restraint on innovative activities, and ongoing trial-and-error experimentation to improve systems and technologies.  MODELING THE POTENTIAL COSTS OF PREEMPTIVE REGULATION In an effort to show how important a rapid deployment of HAV technology is, we have constructed a model to project the expected number of lives lost as a result of regulatory delay. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to predict exactly how much slower the diffusion rate of HAVs will be with a cumbersome premarket approval regime, so we have forecasted the expected loss of life at three different slowdown rates: 5 percent, 10 percent, and 25 percent. Table 1 illustrates these predictions. 38. Virginia Postrel, The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict over Creativity, Enterprise, and Progress (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1998), 199. 39.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  9  If NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s proposed premarket approval process slows the deployment of HAVs by 5 percent, we project an additional 15,500 fatalities over the course of the next 31 years. At 10 percent regulatory delay, we project an additional 34,600 fatalities over 33 years. And at 25 percent regulatory delay, we project an additional 112,400 fatalities over 40 years. TABLE 1. ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL FATALITIES AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF REGULATORY DELAY Regulatory delay  Additional fatalities  Time until HAV saturation  5 percent  15,500  31 years  10 percent  34,600  33 years  25 percent  112,400  40 years  This model works by first estimating the diffusion curve along which HAVs will be adopted, then slowing the slope of that curve by the rate of regulatory delay. In order to illustrate how the model works, we will specify the rate of regulatory delay as 10 percent. FIGURE 2. ESTIMATED DISPLACEMENT OF NONAUTONOMOUS MILES DRIVEN  100%  percentage of miles driven by HAVs  80%  60%  original HAV displacement 10% slowdown  40%  20%  0% 2017  2020  2023  2026 2029 2032  2035  2038  2041  2044 2047 2050  The first step is projecting the expected displacement of nonautonomous miles by HAVs and semiautonomous vehicles. In figure 2, the blue line shows our projected timeline for the percentage of total miles driven that has been displaced by autonomous miles. In red is the revised timeline with a 10 percent slowdown as a result of regulatory delay. Although both scenarios  MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  10  eventually reach the same level of adoption, the total number of human-driven miles over the time frame is significantly larger with regulatory delay. With a slower HAV rollout comes a larger number of yearly fatalities as human drivers remain on the road for longer periods of time. Figure 3 shows these fatality projections.  FIGURE 3.

The space between the two curves represents the estimated number of fatalities owing to regulatory delay. While the space may look small, the huge number of fatalities each year adds up quickly. In the event of a 10 percent slowdown, an additional 34,600 people will die over the rollout period. Because of the inherent uncertainty surrounding the actual level of regulatory delay, we wanted to show how the fatalities vary over a wide spectrum from a 1 percent to a 50 percent slowdown. Figure 4 illustrates these results. Even with only a 1 percent slowdown, we would expect an additional 3,000 fatalities. On the upper end of the projection, with a 50 percent slowdown, we could see as many as 378,500 fatalities.  MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  11  FIGURE 4.

The adoption period varies based on the level of regulatory delay, between 30 years with no slowdown and 60 years with a 50 percent slowdown. Our hope is that this model can give NHTSA and other commentators a baseline from which to compare a premarket approval regime and other regulatory approaches. The \xe2\x80\x9ccost of caution\xe2\x80\x9d is often difficult to quantify, but this model should give NHTSA some insight as to just how costly a delay in HAV technology can be. We detail the assumptions underlying our model in the appendix.  ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS In this section we comment on an area that the NHTSA mentioned in the guidance document and that has been a larger topic of conversation in the industry for the past several years: the ethical considerations of driverless cars. More specifically, how should a self-driving car be programmed to act during an unavoidable accident? While we do not intend to give a robust analysis of all aspects of this debate, we do want to counsel the agency against requiring a solution to this thorny moral problem before allowing driverless cars on the market. And on a more fundamental level, it might be the wrong question to ask. The MIT Technology Review sets up the following scenario: Imagine that in the not-too-distant future, you own a self-driving car. One day, while you are driving along, an unfortunate set of events causes the car to head  MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  12  toward a crowd of 10 people crossing the road. It cannot stop in time but it can avoid killing 10 people by steering into a wall. However, this collision would kill you, the owner and occupant. What should it do?43 Should the car be programmed to save its passengers at all costs? Or maximize the number of lives saved? These are difficult questions that don\xe2\x80\x99t have clear and obvious answers. But it may be counterproductive to force the industry to answer them at this time. Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin with how likely these kinds of situations may be in the first place. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to imagine the situation painted above because human drivers are faced with similar situations frequently. But the whole point of driverless cars is to reduce the frequency of the \xe2\x80\x9cunfortunate set of events\xe2\x80\x9d that leads to these ethical dilemmas. With 360-degree visibility around the vehicle and millisecond response time, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine a scenario where this might actually occur. By eliminating most of the routine traffic accidents, HAVs will encounter only those accident scenarios in the tail-end of the probability distribution, which are the most difficult to foresee and plan for. In short, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether situations like these will actually arise, and the only way to find out is to allow more experimentation, see what problems arise, and then find solutions to address them ex post. Second, NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s priority has to be getting driverless cars onto the streets as quickly as possible, using a combination of regulatory restraint and the sort of best practices and postmarket oversight described above. Anything that slows this process down has to be weighed against the significant costs of delay outlined in the model above. Requiring all members of the industry to get on board with a single solution to this complex problem is likely to be a time-consuming endeavor. And given the relative infrequency of these situations, the cost of delay seems likely to dwarf any gains from a unified solution, assuming one could be agreed on. Additionally, the engineers and leadership at HAV companies have an opportunity cost. The more time they are required to spend contemplating ethical quandaries that will rarely occur in real life, the less time they can spend setting up failsafe systems for the brakes, improving cross-platform communication between different HAV manufacturers, or refining the software identification system\xe2\x80\x94all things that can prevent crashes in the first place. Finally, the government can focus on alternative measures to further decrease the likelihood of these problems arising. As our colleague Brent Skorup has highlighted, having smarter infrastructure like roadside sensors can allow \xe2\x80\x9cdriverless cars to \xe2\x80\x98see\xe2\x80\x99 some information that\xe2\x80\x99s blocks or miles away in real time\xe2\x80\x94such as a dog running into the street, a speeding ambulance, or a swerving driver.\xe2\x80\x9d44 With this kind of situational awareness delivered to all, it is our opinion that trying to prevent these ethical dilemmas from occurring in the first place is preferable to planning for every conceivable permutation of the driverless car trolley problem.45 43.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  13  As driverless cars continue to improve and evolve, so will our intuitions about the best thing to do in any given situation. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t let ourselves be so paralyzed by the fear of making the wrong decision that we slow the deployment of driverless cars and inadvertently kill more people as a result. Again, it is important that policymakers not get too caught up in attempts to preemptively resolve every potential hypothetical scenario. The problem with that approach was nicely summarized by the late political scientist Aaron Wildavsky when he noted, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can do nothing without knowing first how it will turn out, you cannot do anything at all.\xe2\x80\x9d46 The goal of zero fatalities on the road will be even more elusive if policymakers are paralyzed by fear of the unknown and refuse to allow real-world experimentation with HAV technologies. Only ongoing trial-and-error experimentation will help us find answers to the truly hard questions about how to radically improve the safety of motor vehicles. Are there risks with such an approach? Of course, but there are far greater risks associated with the operation baseline of the human-driven vehicles that populate our roads today. Some advocates of preemptive regulation of HAV technology argue that allowing real-world experimentation on the roads means that innovators \xe2\x80\x9care essentially making the commuters the guinea pigs,\xe2\x80\x9d as Joan Claybrook, a consumer-protection advocate and former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, has argued.47 But arguments such as these ignore the reality that members of the general public are already guinea pigs in an ongoing real-world experiment with human-driven vehicles, and that experiment continues to produce very troubling results. Human abilities haven\xe2\x80\x99t radically improved in recent years, and we certainly aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting significantly better at driving. Most of the safety improvements in recent decades came about because of improvements in other systems, materials, and technologies in and around vehicles. But these improvements can only go so far to counter the fact that humans are fallible, and mistakes will always lead to problems, for both themselves and others around them on the road. HAV systems offer the nation the first opportunity to make radical near-term improvements in terms of accidents avoided and lives saved. But that can only happen by allowing real-world HAV experimentation today. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t develop the technology and deploy it, it never gets better,\xe2\x80\x9d argues Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia Corp., whose chips are used to power autonomous driving and other artificial-intelligence applications.48 \xe2\x80\x9cAt some level, you have to put it on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d These systems can only \xe2\x80\x9clearn\xe2\x80\x9d how to become safer and more secure through ongoing real-world experiments. \xe2\x80\x9cThe software becomes better and better over use,\xe2\x80\x9d Huang observes.49  46.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  14  Again, at the end of the day, the safety and security considerations surrounding these technologies must be compared to the current real-world baseline of excessive accidents attributable to human error. As Tom Vanderbilt of Wired correctly concludes, Every scenario you can spin out of computer error\xe2\x80\x94What if the car drives the wrong way\xe2\x80\x94already exists in analog form, in abundance. Yes, computer-guidance systems and the rest will require advances in technology, not to mention redundancy and higher standards of performance, but at least these are all feasible, and capable of quantifiable improvement. On the other hand, we\xe2\x80\x99ll always have lousy drivers.50  CONCLUSION It is vital that NHTSA realizes that its policy deliberations and decisions in this matter are not happening in a vacuum. We increasingly live in a world where \xe2\x80\x9cglobal innovation arbitrage\xe2\x80\x9d is a reality.51 Just as capital moves seamlessly around the globe seeking out hospitable regulatory treatment, the same is increasingly true for cutting-edge innovations. Innovators can and will move to countries and continents that provide a legal and regulatory environment that is hospitable to entrepreneurial activity.52 If HAV entrepreneurs feel that America\xe2\x80\x99s approach to innovation policy stacks the deck against them, they will seek out alternative venues where experimentation can continue in a relatively unabated fashion. Some entrepreneurs are already threatening to do so.53 To avoid that fate and ensure that America remains at the forefront of HAV innovation worldwide, to the maximum extent possible NHTSA should attempt to make its default policy position \xe2\x80\x9cInnovation Allowed.\xe2\x80\x9d Prior restraint must be avoided as much as possible. Just as policymakers did not preemptively foreclose innovation with previous digital technologies such as the Internet, NHTSA should avoid artificially restricting new forms of HAV innovation today with overly prescriptive regulations. Considering the lives at stake in this matter, the burden of proof rests on those who favor precautionary regulation to explain why ongoing experimentation with new and better ways of doing things should be prevented.  50.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  15  APPENDIX: ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE MODEL In the interest of transparency, we wanted to clearly state our assumptions in building this model. We intentionally tried to err on the side of overly modest assumptions in order not to inflate the number of additional lives lost as a result of regulatory delay. In this model we have assumed a number of parameters: HAVs will be adopted along a normal logistic function. The academic literature has shown that new technologies are typically adopted along an \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d type logistic function.54 The deployment process for driverless cars will begin in 2017. Automated vehicles with human supervision are currently operating in Pittsburgh with Uber,55 and all Tesla cars currently in production have hardware capable of autonomous driving at SAE-5 levels.56 Additionally, both Ford57 and Lyft58 have stated publicly that they plan to have significant fleets of consumer HAVs ready by 2021. These timelines are consistent with the projection of the model. The estimated initial transition time for the rollout of driverless cars is 30 years. This is consistent with NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s proposed \xe2\x80\x9cRoad to Zero\xe2\x80\x9d goal of having zero traffic fatalities in 30 years. The only realistic way of reaching anywhere close to this ambitious goal is a speedy rollout of driverless cars, with the vast majority of consumers using driverless cars by the end of this 30-year window. It can be argued that the rollout of HAVs will take longer than 30 years, but extending the rollout time frame in the model would only increase the number of lives lost due to regulation over a longer time span. The average growth rate in miles driven per year is 2 percent. This has been the average increase in total miles driven in the United States over the past five years.59 The fatalities per hundred million miles driven by nonautonomous vehicles will continue at a rate of 1.106. This has been the average rate of the five most recent years for which we have data, from 2010 to 2014.60 Note that this rate does not include data from 2015 or 2016; in both of these years, the auto fatality rate in the United States has been higher than in previous years. Autonomous vehicles will initially be 2 times safer than human drivers and grow to be 10 times safer by the end of the original 30-year period. This assumption mirrors those made by professors Daniel J. Fagnant and Kara Kockelman in a paper for the Eno Center for Transportation.61 54.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  16  Additionally, Tesla has driven over 222 million miles in autopilot mode, according to Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s statement of the most recent figures.62 With only one US fatality as a result of autopilot to date,63 HAV technology is more than twice as safe as the average human-driven US automobile. While this figure is still unreliable because of a small sample size, it represents the best real-world estimate we have to date about the relative safety of HAVs. Every HAV on the road will drive 1.5 times as many miles as a human driver. This assumption accounts for the decreased marginal cost of driving an extra mile using an HAV and the corresponding increase in miles driven we would expect as a result. The actual displacement effect is impossible to know beforehand, but we thought it was important to assume a generous rate to ensure our final projections were not artificially high. The maximum crowd-out of HAVs in the market is 95 percent. While HAVs are likely to be widely adopted once they are available, there are holdouts with every technology. Unless HAVs become federally mandated to use when driving on highways, we will not reach 100 percent HAV market crowd-out.  62.
