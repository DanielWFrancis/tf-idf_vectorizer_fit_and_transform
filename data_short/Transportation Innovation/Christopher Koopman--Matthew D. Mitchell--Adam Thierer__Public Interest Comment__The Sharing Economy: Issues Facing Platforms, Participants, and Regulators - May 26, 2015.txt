 b'Bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems  PUBLIC INTEREST COMMENT  THE SHARING ECONOMY: ISSUES FACING PLATFORMS, PARTICIPANTS, AND REGULATORS Christopher Koopman, Matthew Mitchell, and Adam Thierer 1 Agency: Federal Trade Commission Submitted: May 26, 2015 Sharing Economy Workshop, Project No. P15-1200  I. INTRODUCTION The Mercatus Center at George Mason University is dedicated to advancing knowledge about the impact of regulation on society. As part of its mission, the Mercatus Center conducts careful and independent analyses employing contemporary economic scholarship to assess rulemaking proposals from the perspective of the public interest. Thus, this comment before the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) does not represent the views of any particular affected party or special interest group. Rather, it is designed to assist the commission as it weighs the costs and benefits of regulation that affects the sharing economy. Our comments to the commission are derived from recent Mercatus Center working papers on these issues.2 1.

II. THE IMPACT OF THE SHARING ECONOMY In its workshop announcement, the commission asks, \xe2\x80\x9cHow have sharing economy platforms affected competition, innovation, consumer choice, and platform participants in the sectors in which they operate? How might they in the future?\xe2\x80\x9d To understand the impact that the sharing economy has had on competition, innovation, and consumer choice, it is important to define the sharing economy. In its broadest sense, we argue that the sharing economy is any marketplace that uses the Internet to bring together distributed networks of individuals to share or exchange otherwise underutilized assets.3 Thus, it encompasses all manner of goods and services shared or exchanged for both monetary and nonmonetary benefit. The sectors in which the sharing economy has seen substantial growth\xe2\x80\x94and has created the most disruption\xe2\x80\x94include transportation, hospitality, dining, goods, finance, and personal services. We have identified five ways the sharing economy is creating value for both consumers and producers: 1.  By giving people an opportunity to use other people\xe2\x80\x99s cars, kitchens, apartments, and other property, it allows underutilized assets or \xe2\x80\x9cdead capital\xe2\x80\x9d to be put to more productive use.4  2. By bringing together multiple buyers and sellers, it makes both the supply and demand sides of its markets more competitive and allows greater specialization. 3. By lowering the cost of finding willing traders, haggling over terms, and monitoring performance, it cuts transaction costs and expands the scope of trade.5 4. By aggregating the reviews of past consumers and producers and putting them at the fingertips of new market participants, it can significantly diminish the problem of asymmetric information between producers and consumers.6  3. See, for example, Rachel Botsman, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sharing Economy Lacks a Shared Definition,\xe2\x80\x9d Fast Company website, Novem\xad ber 21, 2013, http://www.fastcoexist.com/3022028/the-sharing-economy-lacks-a-shared-definition. It may be helpful to think of a sharing economy as a special case of a two-sided or platform market. It is special because it typically employs technology to bring together large numbers of buyers and sellers.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  2  5. By offering an end run around regulators who are captured by existing producers, it allows suppliers to create value for customers long underserved by those incumbents that have become inefficient and unresponsive because of their regulatory protections. These factors can improve consumer welfare by offering new innovations, more choices, more service differentiation, better prices, and higher-quality services. In short, as the commission\xe2\x80\x99s workshop notice puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cThe development of the sharing economy can stimulate economic growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and promoting more productive and efficient use of assets.\xe2\x80\x9d Irrespective of how the sharing economy creates value, the revealed preferences of both consumers and producers suggest that it does create a substantial amount of economic value. As the commission notes, \xe2\x80\x9cSharing economy transactions have increased rapidly in recent years, reaching an estimated value of $26 billion globally in 2013, and some estimates predict that the sharing economy will generate as much as $110 billion annually in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d Much of this value flows to individuals who would otherwise be unable to compete in these markets. For those entering the sharing economy as producers, these new platforms create opportunities to generate income from sources that were historically available only to a select few. In the recent past, only those with access to the capital necessary to build hotels could offer rooms as short-term rentals. But firms such as Airbnb and HomeAway allow individuals to penetrate markets traditionally dominated by large incumbents such as Hilton Worldwide and Marriott International. In 2014, for example, guest stays through Airbnb totaled nearly 22 percent more than Hilton Worldwide.7 And recent projections estimate that the sharing economy has the potential to increase over twentyfold in terms of revenue by 2025.8 As we have noted in our previous research, the increased competition from the continued growth of the sharing economy will have direct, positive effects on consumer welfare.9 First, and most obviously, these firms give consumers access to a broader range of goods and services. The ease of entry and innovation in the online world mean that new entrants in the sharing economy can provide better options and address consumer needs in ways that more traditional business models cannot. According to surveys, consumers currently take advantage of sharing economy services primarily because they offer better prices, a sense of community, greater convenience, and higher quality.10 In terms of greater convenience and quality, comparisons of Yelp ratings in almost any major city where ride-sharing firms operate demonstrate  7.

Many economists have worried about the existence of information asymmetries between producers and consumers, and they have argued that this asymmetry justifies many consumer protection regulations. However, the Internet largely solves this problem by providing consumers with robust search and monitoring tools so that they may find more and better choices.13 These tools lower the transaction costs of searching for willing trade partners, haggling with them over terms, and monitoring them for compliance. We will discuss these tools, especially reputational mechanisms, in more detail in section VI.  III. BALANCING REGULATION, COMPETITION, AND INNOVATION The commission asks, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can state and local regulators meet legitimate regulatory goals (such as protecting consumers and promoting public health and safety) in connection with their oversight of sharing economy platforms and business models, without also restraining competition or hindering innovation?\xe2\x80\x9d Additionally, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s notice observes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe rapid expansion of commercial activity involving smaller suppliers on these platforms may tax the abilities and resources of regulators, who are confronted with the challenge of applying regulations that were written with conventional suppliers in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d As the debate surrounding the sharing economy moves forward, policymakers must keep in mind that merely because regulations were once justified on the grounds of consumer \xadprotection does not mean they accomplished those goals or that they are still needed today.14 Even well-intentioned policies must be judged against real-world evidence.15 Unfortunately, the evidence shows that many traditional consumer protection regulations hurt consumers;  11.

(\xe2\x80\x9cIntentions are not results.\xe2\x80\x9d)  MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  4  in the words of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, they are often \xe2\x80\x9ccumbersome, and some are just plain protectionist.\xe2\x80\x9d16 Markets, competition, reputational systems, and ongoing innovation often solve problems better than regulation when they are given a chance to do so. There are two reasons for this. First, market imperfections create powerful profit opportunities for entrepreneurs who are able to find ways to correct them.17 Second, regulatory solutions too often undermine competition and lock in inefficient business models. As FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright recently explained, when an incumbent faces competition from innovative firms, such as those making up the sharing economy, the potential responses can be broken into three categories: (1) competition on the merits, (2) exclusionary conduct, and (3) raising rivals\xe2\x80\x99 costs through \xe2\x80\x9cpublic competition.\xe2\x80\x9d18 The first category of conduct\xe2\x80\x94competition on the merits\xe2\x80\x94is the ideal response and requires little to no involvement on the part of regulators. The second category of conduct\xe2\x80\x93exclusionary conduct\xe2\x80\x93is typically corrected through antitrust enforcement. However, the third category of conduct\xe2\x80\x94what Wright refers to as public competition\xe2\x80\x94often uses regulators and regulations to limit the ability of new entrants to compete in the market. In some cases, regulations are conspicuously protectionist. Such was the case when the District of Columbia City Council originally proposed legislation requiring ride-sharing firms to charge no less than five times what taxis charge. The \xe2\x80\x9cexplanation and rationale\xe2\x80\x9d section of the legislation declared that \xe2\x80\x9cthese requirements would ensure that sedan service is a premium class of service with a substantially higher cost that does not directly compete with or undercut taxicab service.\xe2\x80\x9d19 More often, however, regulations that ultimately protect incumbents from competition begin as \xe2\x80\x9cconsumer protection\xe2\x80\x9d measures. This is because in \xe2\x80\x9cpublic competition\xe2\x80\x9d a small number of incumbent firms are often able to exert greater pressure on policymakers than can either the consumers or the new entrants against whom regulatory protections discriminate. A large body of research documents this phenomenon of \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory capture\xe2\x80\x9d and offers a number of explanations for it.20 First, by being small in number, incumbent firms typically find it easier 16.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  5  than either competitors or consumers to overcome the collective action problem and to organize on behalf of their interests.21 Second, because there appear to be increasing returns to political engagement, firms that pursue public competition tend to get better at it the more they do it.22 Third, incumbents tend to enjoy information asymmetries relative to their regulators. These firms therefore often become an important source of information for regulators, allowing the firms to exercise a great deal of influence on the regulatory process.23 Finally, firms often exercise outsized influence over their regulators because a revolving door creates constant personnel flows back and forth between regulators and the firms they oversee.24 Often, incumbents who oppose new entry or increased competition from innovators will lobby legislators and regulators to apply otherwise outmoded regulations on new entrants in the name of fairness. Incumbents argue that they still face these various regulatory burdens and that new entrants should as well. These burdens include licensing requirements, price controls, service area restrictions, marketing limitations, and technology standards. Licensing procedures are of particular concern for the sharing economy because they have the potential to create serious barriers to entry. A recent Supreme Court amicus brief signed by over 50 leading antitrust and public choice scholars noted that occupational licensing, once limited to a few licensed professions, is widespread and growing\xe2\x80\x94from 5% of the U.S. workforce in the 1950s, to 15% in the 1970s, to 30% today. Occupational licensing has been abused by incumbent market participants to exclude rivals, often in unreasonable ways, and to raise prices. This disturbing trend already costs consumers billions of dollars every year and impedes job growth.25 As our colleague Veronique de Rugy has noted, \xe2\x80\x9cLicensing can become a powerful tool to limit innovation and competition and act to limit upward mobility.\xe2\x80\x9d26 Therefore, the commission should highlight how incumbents might use licensing practices to serve their narrow interests at the expense of new sharing economy entrants. On the other hand, exempting newcomers from traditional regulations could place incumbents at a disadvantage. Such regulatory asymmetries represent a legitimate policy problem. But the 21.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  6  solution is not to discourage new innovations by simply rolling old regulatory regimes onto new technologies and sectors. The better alternative is to level the playing field by \xe2\x80\x9cderegulating down\xe2\x80\x9d to put everyone on equal footing, not by \xe2\x80\x9cregulating up\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve parity.27 Policymakers should relax old rules on incumbents as new entrants and new technologies challenge the status quo\xe2\x80\x94especially when new innovations seem to correct market imperfections better than the outmoded regulations. By extension, new entrants should only face minimal regulatory requirements as more onerous and unnecessary restrictions on incumbents are relaxed. As noted next, to the extent other harms need to be addressed, there exist many alternative remedies to consider instead of traditional top-down and preemptive regulation.  IV. ADDRESSING HARM AND LIABILITY The commission asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat particular concerns or issues do sharing economy transactions raise regarding the protection of platform participants? What responsibility does a sharing economy platform bear for consumer injury arising from transactions undertaken through the platform?\xe2\x80\x9d Preemptive, precautionary regulation is not the only way to address accidents or bad corporate behavior. Alternative remedies are available. And these alternatives have the added benefit of not discouraging innovation or competition, as traditional regulation often has. By trying to head off every hypothetical worst-case scenario, preemptive regulations actually discourage many best-case scenarios from ever coming about.28 For that reason, ex post remedies are often preferable to ex ante regulation. Private insurance, contracts, torts and product liability law, antitrust enforcement, and other legal remedies can be utilized here when things go wrong, just as they are used in countless other segments of our economy. Patience is essential in this regard. New legal standards and liability norms tend to evolve gradually through a body of common-law cases. This evolutionary process is one of the chief virtues of ex post remedies because it gives innovators room to discover new ways of solving problems. Consider, for example, ride-sharing insurance. The advent of ride sharing presented a challenge to the existing insurance model. At $8,000 to $10,000 a year, commercial-grade auto insurance is much more expensive than personal insurance, and many part-time ride-sharing drivers would not do it if they had to pay the premiums themselves.29 To accommodate this need, Uber offered its own $1 million commercial-grade insurance policy for all Uber rides. But in order to ensure that drivers didn\xe2\x80\x99t sign up for Uber as a way to get free insurance, the company stipulated that this $1 million coverage only applied when a passenger was in the vehicle. A driver\xe2\x80\x99s own insurances would apply when his app was off. And when the app was 27.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  7  on but there was no passenger in the car, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s own insurance would apply and Uber would supplement this with contingent liability coverage for damages not covered by personal insurance. Problems arose, however, when some insurance companies canceled drivers\xe2\x80\x99 personal insurance policies as soon as they learned that drivers were Uber partners. The state and local policy responses to these problems have run the full spectrum, including complete bans of ride-sharing companies, prohibitively expensive insurance requirements, and comparatively open models.30 Recognizing the profit opportunity, however the industry itself evolved: In January of 2015, insurance companies began offering a new grade of insurance. It covers drivers when their apps are on and no passengers are in the vehicle. At an additional $6 to $8 per month, it is slightly more expensive than personal insurance but not as costly as commercial insurance31 It took some time for the market to discover this model, and it will likely continue to evolve.32 But the important thing to recognize is that it would not have evolved at all if a few states had not taken a relatively permissive approach to ridesharing insurance, thus guaranteeing a large enough market for the solution to be profitable. Meanwhile, the common law continues to evolve to deal with cases and controversies involving new sectors and disruptive technologies.33 As Brookings Institution scholar John Villasenor observes, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen confronted with new, often complex, questions involving products liability, courts have generally gotten things right.\xe2\x80\x9d34 He further notes that \xe2\x80\x9cproducts liability law has been highly adaptive to the many new technologies that have emerged in recent decades,\xe2\x80\x9d and, by extension, it will adapt to other technologies and developments as cases and controversies come before the courts.35 There is no reason, therefore, to believe that the common law will not adapt to new technological realities, especially since firms have powerful incentives to improve the security of their systems and to avoid punishing liability claims, unwanted press attention, and lost customers.36  30.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  8  Thus, instead of trying to preemptively micromanage sharing economy technologies and platforms in an attempt to plan for every hypothetical risk, policymakers should be patient while the common law evolves, liability norms adjust, and new insurance policies emerge. In particular, policymakers need to be cognizant of the dynamic effects that preemptive, anticipatory regulations have on continued innovation and competition. For example, a number of states have rushed to regulate ride-sharing companies as transportation network companies (TNCs). However, this designation may have serious, unintended consequences as these companies continue to innovate and expand. Recent news that Uber is testing a merchant delivery program provides one example of how these companies may have already outgrown the TNC designation.37 Framing these regulations in the way they are (i.e., a regulatory model built on the idea that drivers will be transporting people rather than objects) begins to introduce new, unnecessary questions regarding a ride-sharing company\xe2\x80\x99s legal status. Is a ride-sharing company that also offers delivery for merchants a licensed TNC when driving people but an unlicensed motor carrier when transporting packages in a state like Virginia, which has separate regulations, licensing, and permitting for each activity? Moreover, as ride-sharing companies continue to experiment with autonomous vehicles,38 these TNC regulations may foreclose the opportunity for firms like Uber to employ these technologies.39 Bringing these services to consumers will likely require regulators to redefine terms such as partner within these TNC laws as well as to redefine the TNC framework with regard to the relationship between the driver, the passenger, and the ride-sharing company. Regardless of how those questions are resolved, these issues would need to be rehashed, re-debated, and settled each time ride sharing outgrows its current classification.  37.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  9  V. CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS TO SPECIFIC CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES The commission asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat consumer protection issues\xe2\x80\x94including privacy and data security, online reviews and disclosures, and claims about earnings and costs\xe2\x80\x94do these platforms raise, and who is responsible for addressing these issues?\xe2\x80\x9d Like many other companies and sectors in today\xe2\x80\x99s economy, the sharing economy\xe2\x80\x99s success\xe2\x80\x94 indeed, its very existence\xe2\x80\x94has been built upon data.40 Data is the fuel that powers the modern information economy.41 The widespread collection and use of data helps expand the array of services available and keeps prices low\xe2\x80\x94or even at zero\xe2\x80\x94for a great number of digital services.42 In the case of the sharing economy, data about interactions is also what facilitates the reputational feedback mechanisms that have been so crucial to the development of trust among diverse parties. (The importance of those reputational mechanisms is discussed at greater length in section VI.) It is vital, therefore, that policymakers exercise extreme caution when addressing concerns about privacy and security in this context, at least to the extent that they are considering regulations that would limit data collection and use.43 Privacy and security are highly subjective values44 that are constantly reshaped as societal attitudes adjust to new cultural and technological realities.45 Often that adjustment process occurs quite rapidly and in ways we probably could not have predicted.46 For example, some of the technologies and business practices that are essential to the sharing economy\xe2\x80\x94such as geolocation capabilities, which allows real-time \xe2\x80\x9ctracking\xe2\x80\x9d of individuals\xe2\x80\x94would have been far more controversial even just a generation ago. 40.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  10  Today, however, consumers have come to appreciate the benefits of such technologies because they give rise to new services\xe2\x80\x94such as real-time traffic updates and the ability to quickly locate friends and family\xe2\x80\x94that offer them tremendous benefits. For these reasons, privacy and security best practices will need to evolve gradually in response to new marketplace realities, and they will need to be applied in a more organic and flexible fashion, often outside the realm of public policy.47 Rigid top-down regulatory approaches to addressing these concerns will impose significant costs on consumers and the economy. If data can\xe2\x80\x99t be collected and used to facilitate transactions or to target new and better services, consumers will suffer.48 Nonetheless, legitimate privacy and security concerns remain. In particular, some worry about how much data sharing economy operators are collecting about consumers and the potentially sensitive nature of some of that data. That does not mean, however, that a top-down, heavily regulatory approach to privacy or security concerns is wise.49 Instead, a balanced and \xe2\x80\x9clayered\xe2\x80\x9d approach is needed that incorporates many solutions.50 When considering privacy-related concerns about sharing economy platforms and technologies, contract law will play a role. The enforcement of contractual promises is one of the most powerful ways to curb potential privacy- or security-related abuses associated with new technologies. When companies make promises to the public about new services or devices, the companies can and should be held to these promises. There are two primary ways to hold firms accountable when they fail to live up to the promises they make to consumers regarding privacy and security practices. First, firms can be held accountable in the courts. The United States \xe2\x80\x9chas a vibrant privacy litigation industry, led by privacy class actions,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Google global privacy counsel Peter Fleischer.51 Class-action lawsuit activity is remarkably intense following not just major privacy violations but also data breaches,52 and there is evidence that \xe2\x80\x9chow federal courts define the damages people suffer from data breaches is broadening dramatically, leaving unprepared  47.

Ibid. According to Fleischer, \xe2\x80\x9cWithin hours of any newspaper headline (accurate or not) alleging any sort of privacy mistake, a race begins among privacy class action lawyers to find a plaintiff and file a class action. Most of these class actions are soon dismissed, or settled as nuisance suits, because most of them fail to be able to demonstrate any \xe2\x80\x98harm\xe2\x80\x99 from the alleged privacy breach. But a small percentage of privacy class actions do result in large transfers of money, first and foremost to the class action lawyers themselves, which is enough to keep the wheels of the litigationmachine turning.\xe2\x80\x9d  MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  11  companies at a greater risk of big payouts in class-action lawsuits.\xe2\x80\x9d53 Such action by the courts disciplines firms that violate privacy and data security norms while sending a signal to other online operators about their data policies and procedures.54 Second, the FTC itself will continue to play a major role in forcing companies to live up to the privacy- and security-related promises they make to the public. The commission possesses broad consumer protection powers under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.55 Section 5 prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d56 The FTC formalized its process for dealing with unfairness claims in its 1984 Policy Statement on Unfairness and noted, \xe2\x80\x9cTo justify a finding of unfairness the injury must satisfy three tests. It must be substantial; it must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that the practice produces; and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d57 (Importantly, however, the Policy Statement stipulated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe injury must be substantial. The Commission is not concerned with trivial or merely speculative harms. . . . Emotional impact and other more subjective types of harm . . . will not ordinarily make a practice unfair.\xe2\x80\x9d58) In recent years, the FTC has brought and settled many cases involving its section 5 authority to address identity theft and data security matters and, generally speaking, has been able to identify clear harms in each case.59 Importantly, the commission can use it advocacy and awareness-building role to push for greater consumer education and corporate transparency. Transparency and disclosure policies are generally more sensible than restrictive rules, which preemptively foreclose innovation opportunities.60 Finally, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s workshop notice mentioned concerns about the consumer protection issues surrounding \xe2\x80\x9cclaims about earnings and costs.\xe2\x80\x9d But to the extent that these 53.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  12  concerns grow to be a problem, it is unclear why policymakers should approach sharing economy operations any differently than they do the rest of the economy. As with misleading privacy and security claims, if fraudulent claims about earnings and costs are made by sharing economy operators, the commission and other government bodies (including state attorneys general) already possess tools to address such unfair and deceptive practices. And an extensive body of financial reporting rules already exist to address such issues as well. No additional authority is needed for financial reporting in the sharing economy.  VI. THE POWER OF REPUTATIONAL FEEDBACK MECHANISMS The commission asks, \xe2\x80\x9cHow effective are reputation systems and other trust mechanisms, such as the vetting of sellers, insurance coverage, or complaint procedures, in encouraging consumers and suppliers to do business on sharing economy platforms?\xe2\x80\x9d A new Mercatus Center working paper squarely addresses the effectiveness of modern reputational feedback systems and trust-building mechanisms, and compares them to other systems that have been used throughout history.61 The study shows that, by facilitating greater trust while simultaneously opening up new innovations and opportunities, these new Internet-based mechanisms promise to revolutionize modern marketplace interactions and help market actors overcome information asymmetries, or what is sometimes referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9clemons problem.\xe2\x80\x9d62 Reputational mechanisms have always existed, but they were somewhat crude in the past. More than 250 years ago in his classic The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith observed, \xe2\x80\x9cWe desire both to be respectable and to be respected.\xe2\x80\x9d People\xe2\x80\x99s success in life, he noted, \xe2\x80\x9calmost always depends upon the favour and good opinion of their neighbours and equals; and without a tolerably regular conduct, these can very seldom be obtained. The good old proverb, therefore, that honesty is the best policy, holds, in such situations, almost always perfectly true.\xe2\x80\x9d63 Unfortunately, however, before the Internet, \xe2\x80\x9creputations travel[led] haphazardly through word of mouth, rumor, or the mass media,\xe2\x80\x9d making it much more challenging to build trust between strangers involved in commercial interactions.64 The Internet and the information revolution have given rise to new online feedback mechanisms that have made it easier than ever for honesty to be enforced through strong reputational incentives. This has, in turn, alleviated many traditional concerns about informational deficiencies. With the recent growth of the sharing economy, even more robust reputational feedback mechanisms now exist that help consumers solve information problems and secure 61. See Thierer et al., \xe2\x80\x9cHow the Internet, the Sharing Economy and Reputation Feedback Mechanisms Solve the \xe2\x80\x98Lemons Problem.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d 62.

These mechanisms have been integrated into the platforms connecting buyers and sellers and have become an essential feature of these sectors. By providing constructive solutions to the lemons problem that decades of regulations have failed to overcome, the Internet and real-time reputational feedback mechanisms should force a reevaluation of traditional regulations aimed at addressing perceived market failures based on asymmetric information. Such regulations have typically failed to improve consumer welfare and have undermined innovation and competition. This may explain why, when recently surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, 64 percent of US consumers said that in the sharing economy, peer regulation is more important than government regulation.65 From the perspective of the regulator, as Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen has noted in recent speeches, this reality requires a level of \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory humility\xe2\x80\x9d that recognizes the inherent limitations of most traditional regulatory approaches, as well as the rapid speed of technological change and \xe2\x80\x9ccreative destruction\xe2\x80\x9d taking place within these sectors.66 Uber\xe2\x80\x99s ban in Las Vegas reveals the stark difference between traditional regulation and the textbook ideal. As Firefox founder Blake Ross explains, for years authorities have been trying to keep taxis from scamming tourists by taking them the wrong way from the Las Vegas airport to the Vegas Strip.67 Using the tools available to a regulator, the Nevada Taxicab Authority tried everything from roadside checkpoints to giant signs to creating a system for passengers to submit reports when they were taken to the strip by the wrong route. All to no avail. In contrast, the sharing economy is able to solve a problem that has stymied the Nevada regulators over several decades. Through its five-star rating system and electronic ride records, Uber is able to learn instantly when a passenger believes a driver has taken the wrong route and can easily verify whether or not a long haul occurred.68 However, in the name of consumer protection, Uber was banned. As a result, tourists in Las Vegas are unable to take advantage of this service, and they are left with the Taxicab Authority\xe2\x80\x99s patchwork of solutions that are not serving them well. The question facing federal policymakers, as noted in the next sections, is whether and in what ways they can respond to and challenge local regulations with anticompetitive effects that ultimately reduce consumer welfare.  65.

FEDERAL RESPONSES TO LOCAL ANTICOMPETITIVE REGULATIONS The commission possesses two primary tools to address public restraints of trade created by state and local authorities: advocacy and antitrust.69 Through its advocacy program, the commission can provide specific comments to state and local officials regarding the effects of both proposed and existing regulations.70 Commissioner Joshua Wright has noted that \xe2\x80\x9cfor many years, the FTC has used its mantle to comment on legislation and regulation that may restrain competition in a way that harms consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d71 Thus, at a minimum, the commission can and should shine light on parochial government efforts to restrain trade and limit innovation throughout the sharing economy.72 By shining more light on state or local anticompetitive rules, the commission will hopefully make governments or their surrogate bodies (such as licensing boards) more transparent about their practices and more accountable for laws or regulations that could harm consumer welfare. However, to be successful, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy efforts depend upon the willingness of state and local legislators and regulators to heed its advice.73 The commission has already used its advisory role in its recent guidance to state and local policymakers regarding the regulation of ride-sharing services. The commission noted then that \xe2\x80\x9ca regulatory framework should be responsive to new methods of competition,\xe2\x80\x9d and it set forth the following vision regarding what it regards as the proper approach to parochial regulation of passenger transportation services: Staff recommends that a regulatory framework for passenger vehicle transportation should allow for flexibility and adaptation in response to new and innovative methods of competition, while still maintaining appropriate consumer protections. [Regulators] also should proceed with caution in responding to calls for  69. See Maureen K.

In general, competition should only be restricted when necessary to achieve some countervailing procompetitive virtue or other public benefit such as protecting the public from significant harm.74 This view represents a reasonable framework for addressing concerns about parochial regulation of the sharing economy more generally. Unfortunately, in areas relevant to the regulation of the sharing economy (e.g., taxicab regulations and rules governing home and apartment rentals) anticompetitive regulations have remained on the books\xe2\x80\x94and in some instances have expanded\xe2\x80\x94in spite of more than 30 years of commission comment and advocacy.75 In fact, as Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy organization, noted in a recent Supreme Court filing, Many more occupations are regulated than ever before, and most boards doing the regulating\xe2\x80\x94in both traditional and new professions\xe2\x80\x94are dominated by industry members who compete in the regulated market. Those board member-competitors, in turn, commonly engage in regulation that can be seen as anticompetitive selfprotection. The particular forms anticompetitive regulations take are highly varied, the possibilities seemingly limited only by the imaginations of the board members.76 In these instances, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s antitrust enforcement authority may need to be utilized when its advocacy efforts fall short with regard to regulations that favor incumbents by limiting competition and entry.77 Many academics have endorsed expanded antitrust oversight of public barriers to trade and innovation.78 As Commissioner Wright has argued, \xe2\x80\x9cThe FTC is in a good position to use its full arsenal of tools to ensure that state and local regulators do not thwart new entrants from using technology to disrupt existing marketplaces.\xe2\x80\x9d79 He notes  74.

The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision in North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission made it clear that local authorities cannot claim broad immunity from federal antitrust laws.81 This is particularly true, the court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a State delegates control over a market to a nonsovereign actor,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a professional licensing board consisting primarily of members of the affected interest being regulated.82 \xe2\x80\x9cLimits on state-action immunity are most essential when a State seeks to delegate its regulatory power to active market participants,\xe2\x80\x9d the court held, \xe2\x80\x9cfor dual allegiances are not always apparent to an actor and prohibitions against anticompetitive self-regulation by active market participants are an axiom of federal antitrust policy.\xe2\x80\x9d83 The touchstone of this case and the court\xe2\x80\x99s related jurisprudence in this area is political accountability.84 State officials must (1) \xe2\x80\x9cclearly articulate\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) \xe2\x80\x9cactively supervise\xe2\x80\x9d licensing arrangements and regulatory bodies if they hope to withstand federal antitrust scrutiny.85 The court clarified this test in N.C. Dental, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Sherman Act confers immunity only if the State accepts political accountability for the anticompetitive conduct it permits and controls.\xe2\x80\x9d86 In other words, if state and local officials want to engage in protectionist activities that restrain trade in pursuit of some other countervailing objective, then they need to own  80.

While that may be true, some limits on the commission\xe2\x80\x99s federal antitrust discretion are necessary to avoid impinging upon legitimate state and local priorities. Over time, it is our hope that, by empowering the public with more options, more information, and better ways to shine light on bad actors, the sharing economy will continue to make many of those old regulations unnecessary. Thus, in line with Commissioner Ohlhausen\xe2\x80\x99s wise advice, the commission should encourage state and local officials to exercise patience and humility as they confront technological changes that disrupt traditional regulatory systems.88 But when parochial regulators engage in blatantly anticompetitive activities that restrain trade, foster cartelization, or harm consumer welfare in other ways, the commission can act to counter the worst of those tendencies.89 The commission\xe2\x80\x99s standard of review going forward was appropriately articulated by Commissioner Wright recently when he noted that \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of potentially disruptive forms of competition through new technologies or new business models, we should generally be skeptical of regulatory efforts that have the effect of favoring incumbent industry participants.\xe2\x80\x9d90 Such parochial protectionist barriers to trade and innovation will become even more concerning as the potential reach of so many businesses in the sharing economy grows larger. The boundary between intrastate and interstate commerce is sometimes difficult to determine for many sharing economy platforms. Clearly, much of the commerce in question occurs within the boundaries of a state or municipality, but sharing economy services also rely upon Internet-enabled platforms with a broader reach.

VIII. CONCLUSION: NEXT STEPS We will conclude with a few possible next steps for the commission to consider: \xe2\x80\xa2  The commission should continue to utilize its advocacy role to provide guidance to state and local officials grappling with how to adjust traditional regulatory practices in light of new disruptive technologies. The commission has already provided good advice to some state and local regulators seeking guidance in reforming public transportation regulations that impact new entry and innovation in the ride-sharing sector. That advice can be formalized and extended to cover other sharing economy platforms. And the commission should push this advice out to state and local officials even if input is not formally requested.93  \xe2\x80\xa2  The commission should shift enforcement efforts away from stopping private restraint of trade and toward stopping public restraint of trade. In light of George Stigler\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9cthe state has one basic resource which in pure principle is not shared with even the mightiest of its citizens: the power to coerce,\xe2\x80\x9d94 the commission would be wise to adopt Commissioner Wright\xe2\x80\x99s approach and shift resources toward fighting public restraint of trade.  91.

Although many of the leading commentators have expressed serious concern regarding problems posed by interstate spillovers, their thinking has yet to take root in the law.

MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY  19  \xe2\x80\xa2  The commission should consider updating its 2003 State Action Task Force report in light of recent developments in the sharing economy. This would also be wise in light of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision in N.C. Dental. Following that case, the commission and the courts now have a better idea how the \xe2\x80\x9cclear articulation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cactive supervision\xe2\x80\x9d tests will be interpreted going forward. But the commission could clarify these legal principles for both other policymakers and industry. The commission could also use the opportunity to better explain its potential advocacy and enforcement agenda on this front.  The commission should avoid applying any sector- or technology-specific privacy- or security-related policies to sharing economy operators. The commission\xe2\x80\x99s existing best practice guidance for other digital economy operators can be applied more generally to sharing economy operators. And the commission\xe2\x80\x99s section 5 \xe2\x80\x9cunfair and deceptive practices\xe2\x80\x9d authority is already sufficient to deal with missteps on this front. But to the extent that the commission wishes to remind sharing economy operators of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s current approach, it could undertake efforts to push that guidance out to more operators in the hope that they take steps to implement \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy by design\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csecurity by design\xe2\x80\x9d when formulating their business models.95 But the commission should be cautious to avoid disadvantaging certain data-driven business models over others.96  95.
