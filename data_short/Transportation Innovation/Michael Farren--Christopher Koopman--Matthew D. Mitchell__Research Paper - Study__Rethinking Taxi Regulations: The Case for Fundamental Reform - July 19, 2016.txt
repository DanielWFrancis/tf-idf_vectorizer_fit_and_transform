ABSTRACT New technology can disrupt an industry, vastly improving consumer welfare. It can also disrupt policy, vastly improving governance. The advent of \xe2\x80\x9cridesharing\xe2\x80\x9d platforms like Uber and Lyft has prompted regulators everywhere to rethink their approach to the vehicle-for-hire industry. When these technologies first appeared, many local regulators moved either to outlaw them or to achieve parity with taxicabs by regulating these new firms up to the same burdensome level as taxis. More recently, however, policymakers are taking a new approach; they are achieving regulatory parity between ridesharing platforms and taxis by deregulating taxis. Using the District of Columbia as a case study, we assess the current state of affairs in taxi regulation and suggest principles for reform. With the Department of For-Hire Vehicles currently contemplating the creation of a new \xe2\x80\x9cXclass\xe2\x80\x9d service, we argue that now is an opportune time for fundamental reform of the entire regulatory regime in order to create a fair, open, and competitive transportation market.

The advent of \xe2\x80\x9cridesharing\xe2\x80\x9d platforms like Uber and Lyft has prompted regulators everywhere to rethink their approach to the vehicle-for-hire industry. When these technologies first appeared, many local regulators moved either to outlaw them or to achieve parity with taxicabs by regulating these new firms up to the same burdensome level as taxis. More recently, however, policymakers are taking a new approach; they are achieving regulatory parity between ridesharing platforms and taxis by deregulating taxis.1 Using the District of Columbia as a case study, we assess the current state of affairs in taxi regulation and suggest principles for reform. With the Department of For-Hire Vehicles (DFHV) currently contemplating the creation of a new \xe2\x80\x9cXclass\xe2\x80\x9d service, we argue that now is an opportune time for fundamental reform of the entire regulatory regime in order to create a fair, open, and competitive transportation market.2  THE CURRENT APPROACH TO REGULATING THE TAXICAB MARKET IN DC The current approach to municipal taxicab regulations in the United States began in the 1930s. According to some analysts, these regulatory efforts were a response to perceived market failures, especially those due to \xe2\x80\x9casymmetric information\xe2\x80\x9d problems.3 Simply put, it was said that passengers knew little  1.

Moreover, because drivers typically found riders by cruising, riders were said to have little opportunity to compare alternative offerings, limiting both price and quality competition.4 The traditional solution, therefore, was to have the government precertify the taxicab company, its drivers, and its cars, and then govern\xe2\x80\x94in minute detail\xe2\x80\x94 the day-to-day operations of the business. The District of Columbia has historically taken a less intrusive approach to the regulation of the taxi market than have other major metropolitan areas.5 For example, unlike New York City, the District has never issued tradeable licenses known as taxi medallions. But even this comparatively lightly regulated taxi market is highly regulated compared to other industries in the United States. Moreover, legislative mandates and regulatory rules enacted over the past several decades have steadily increased both the burden and the complexity of taxi regulations in the District.6 In July of 2009, for example, then-Chairman Leon J. Swain Jr. of the DC Taxicab Commission (now the DFHV) issued a memorandum imposing a moratorium on \xe2\x80\x9cAn Economic Analysis of Taxicab Regulation\xe2\x80\x9d (Bureau of Economics Staff Report, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC, 1984), 56\xe2\x80\x9357. 4.

The following is a nonexhaustive list of the rules imposed by the DC DFHV. Before they may legally operate, drivers must submit (1) an application form; (2) a medical history; (3) three letters of recommendation; (4) proof of residence; (5) proof of legal residence in the United States; (6) a criminal history request; (7) a driving record; (8) proof that all outstanding tickets have been paid; (9) a \xe2\x80\x9cDC Clean Hands\xe2\x80\x9d form; (10) a \xe2\x80\x9cDC Business Tax Registration\xe2\x80\x9d form; (11) $274.50 in fees (the fee to drive a limo is $299.50, and the fee to drive both is $425.50); and (12) a set of fingerprints for an FBI background check.8 In addition, an aspiring taxi driver must (13) take a taxi-driver competency test, which is separate from the test required to obtain a standard driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.9 Before they may be legally used as vehicles for hire, all taxicabs must (1) have an approved taximeter installed by an approved business (installation costs $150);10 (2) have an approved dome light installed by an approved business (installation costs as high as $700);11 (3) have an approved \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle condition monitoring device\xe2\x80\x9d installed by an approved business in vehicles used after their mandated retirement age (installation costs between $100 and $169);12 (4) comply with uniform requirements for taxicab coloring and markings (paint jobs cost between $400 and $600);13 (5) submit to annual vehicle inspections; (6) comply with vehicle retirement rules that limit the  7.

For a single driver hoping to start his own taxi service, this process can be daunting. In the aggregate, the number of regulatory procedures that we identify (33) and their associated costs\xe2\x80\x94up to $2,643 to drive a single car as a taxi\xe2\x80\x94represent formidable barriers to entry. In some cases, drivers enter the business by renting taxis from established companies and are likely unaware that many of these costs are passed on to them in the form of higher rental prices. All these barriers are in addition to the standard regulatory hurdles that all small businesses must surmount (such as zoning ordinances to open the required office, incorporation rules, and tax compliance costs). This means that trying to open and compete as a taxi company in the District of Columbia requires more procedures than starting a small business in China (12), Venezuela (14), Mozambique (19), or Bolivia (20).18 These countries have become notorious for their excessive barriers to entry, and they are all ranked near the bottom of the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s economy rankings on the ease of doing business.19 14.

CONSEQUENCES OF THE CURRENT REGULATORY APPROACH The requirements outlined above typify the way urban taxi markets have been regulated throughout the United States over the past century. But this exhaustive and intrusive set of rules is antithetical to the basic principles of a free-enterprise or even a mixed economy. Such economies are generally characterized by four elements: (1) personal choice, (2) voluntary exchange through markets, (3) free and open entry, and (4) protection of persons and their property.20 The first three of these conditions\xe2\x80\x94personal choice, voluntary exchange, and free and open entry\xe2\x80\x94are conspicuously absent from most US taxicab markets. Although regulations are often defended on the grounds that they protect consumers, economists and other social scientists have long understood that regulatory restrictions on entry and exhaustive prescriptions for service delivery can be so anticompetitive that they can undermine consumer welfare. The idea that the regulatory process can be \xe2\x80\x9ccaptured\xe2\x80\x9d by the entrenched industry and made to serve its interests rather than those of consumers is supported by the research of progressive thinkers such as Gabriel Kolko, Ralph 20.

As a result, taxi regulation often produces results that are the exact opposite of what was intended:25 \xe2\x80\xa2  Economic theory and decades of empirical evidence suggest that the sorts of price controls imposed on taxis lead to problematic shortages or surpluses.26 If the regulator sets prices too high, the result is wasteful nonprice competition and inefficient production. If prices are set too low, company owners won\xe2\x80\x99t invest sufficiently in their businesses.27 Because firms tend  21.

As a result, taxi regulation often produces results that are the exact opposite of what was intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\xa2  Rules often have unintended consequences. Even the seemingly innocuous requirement that all taxis adopt uniform paint schemes and therefore look nearly alike undermines the incentive for firms to guard the reputation of their brand by vigorously maintaining quality.33  \xe2\x80\xa2  Because these regulations protect incumbent firms from competition, these firms are given a degree of monopoly power and are able to earn above normal profits for a time.34 Economists call these amounts exceeding normal profits \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic rent,\xe2\x80\x9d which comes at the expense of both consumers and would-be competitors. In fact, when firms are protected from competition, economic theory tells us that consumers and would-be competitors lose more than protected firms gain, creating what is known as \xe2\x80\x9cdeadweight loss.\xe2\x80\x9d35  \xe2\x80\xa2  Just as taxi regulation has become a textbook example of regulatory failure, it has also become a textbook example of what is known as \xe2\x80\x9crent-seeking waste.\xe2\x80\x9d36 When policy protects firms from competition, both protected and nonprotected firms undertake costly investments in an effort to influence policy. They expend time and money on political activities and alter their business models in an effort to curry favor with policymakers. Because these firms are seeking economic rent, these activities are known as rent-seeking.37 From a society-wide perspective, rent-seeking is extremely \xadcostly.38 It  the \xe2\x80\x98Lemons Problem\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (Mercatus Working Paper, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, June 2015). 33.

These changes have allowed ridesharing firms, which operate outside the jurisdiction of many taxicab regulators, an opportunity to serve customers while avoiding the encumbrances of antiquated taxicab regulations. As a result, ridesharing firms have rapidly taken market share from taxis. As late as the first quarter of 2014, only 8 percent of business travelers who filed vehicle expense reports through the expense-reporting firm Certify used ridesharing firms, while 37 percent used taxis and the rest rented cars. By the first quarter of 2016, however, fully 46 percent of business travelers used ridesharing firms, while just 14 percent used taxis.43 As consumers have quickly adopted these new services, ridesharing firms have seen their valuations skyrocket. Uber is currently valued at over $60 billion, making it more valuable than both Ford and GM.44  39.

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  11  Ridesharing has also expanded the overall market for transportation services. Studies of the vehicle-for-hire market in New York City and Portland, Oregon, have shown that even while taxis have lost some business to ridesharing, the total number of for-hire rides has vastly increased.45 Meanwhile, areas of New York City that have not been previously well-served by taxis, especially poorer neighborhoods, have seen substantial growth in transportation services offered by ridesharing.46 The dramatic ascendance and enormous valuation of ridesharing firms is partly owing to their ability to create value for customers and to better solve problems, such as asymmetric information, than taxi regulations.47 The technology employed by these new firms has a number of advantages: \xe2\x80\xa2  It prompts all users to rate the service they have received and will often not allow users to use the application again until they have rated their last experience. This prevents some consumers from free riding on the monitoring efforts of other consumers, ensuring that the rating represents the experience of nearly every ride. This is a powerful means to ensure consistently high-quality service.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Customer feedback is instantaneous and continuous, so problems with cleanliness, maintenance, safety, and driver behavior are quickly identified by the steady flow of customers and may be instantly addressed instead of having to wait for infrequent scheduled inspections by regulatory authorities.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Ridesharing technology provides the customer with information, not just on the ridesharing company\xe2\x80\x99s service to past customers but on other riders\xe2\x80\x99 satisfaction with the specific driver offering the service. Branding and commercial reputation are important signals of quality to first-time customers, and most passengers don\xe2\x80\x99t know their taxi or ridesharing drivers before the ride. This signaling more fully solves a critical asymmetricinformation problem that taxi regulations and taxi-driver licensing only partly address.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Technology allows the ridesharing company, which serves as the regulator of the private market it has established and possesses real-time data on  45.

This increased access has been credited with reducing DUI rates and fatal car crashes.50  \xe2\x80\xa2  It permits cashless exchange, which protects both drivers and passengers from theft.  \xe2\x80\xa2  It also allows drivers to rate passengers, incentivizing them to be on their best behavior (this can result in a better experience for the next passenger, too\xe2\x80\x94for example, if it means they will step into a cleaner vehicle). This further improves safety for drivers, since taxi drivers are often the targets of theft and assault and are over 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers. Many of the features that increase passenger safety also benefit drivers in the same way.51  \xe2\x80\xa2  It includes geolocational data so that riders can monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s path while in transit and see if it matches the computer-suggested route.

The astonishing estimated valuation of ridesharing companies also serves as a signal of the lack of competition in regulated taxi markets. Thus, it can be considered a measure of the potential value available to consumers if widespread taxi deregulation were to occur. Ridesharing firms are succeeding by increasing access to high-quality services in a market where supply and quality has long been restricted by regulations.52 Table 2 compares estimated UberX and street-hailed taxi fares for several common trips in the DC metropolitan area. For each service, the table shows both low- and high-end estimates based on traffic volume. Low taxi estimates are, on average, 80 percent more expensive than low UberX estimates, while high taxi estimates are, on average, 310 percent more expensive than high UberX estimates. In fact, in every case, the low taxi estimate exceeds the high UberX estimate. This is clear evidence of a lightly regulated market providing better, cheaper, and more plentiful service than an industry directed by regulation. As the late economist and economic regulator Alfred Kahn so aptly put it, \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever competition is feasible, it is, for all its imperfections, superior to regulation as a means of serving the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d53 There is broad\xe2\x80\x94essentially unanimous\xe2\x80\x94consensus about this fact in the economics profession.

But the question remains: What should policymakers do with the existing taxicab regulatory regime?  PRINCIPLES FOR REFORM Taxi firms and their drivers have invested considerable time, effort, and capital in complying with these rules. Understandably, many are quite resistant to the idea that newcomers should be allowed to enter without paying such a price. But the primary role of the regulator is to protect consumer welfare and not the profits of the incumbent firms. Moreover, the disruptive technologies that have profoundly altered the industry are here to stay. Regulation, then, should be guided by the following six principles.55  Start with a Blank Slate Tastes, technology, and prices change. A healthy and dynamic economy will evolve with these changing conditions.56 Indeed, by the very nature of the market process, entrepreneurs have a strong incentive to drive change by developing  55. These principles were derived in part from Jerry Ellig and Richard Williams, \xe2\x80\x9cReforming Regulatory Analysis, Review, and Oversight: A Guide for the Perplexed\xe2\x80\x9d (Mercatus Working Paper, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, August 2014). 56.

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  15  new business models that correct previous market imperfections.57 But when regulatory privileges protect incumbent firms from competition, this healthy process of change is retarded, stifling both technological progress and economic growth.58 So regulators should constantly approach their task as if they are starting anew. If you were to design regulations today, what would they look like?  Define the Nature of the Problem Begin by identifying a systemic market failure that the regulation is aiming to address.59 First, this step requires a regulator to clearly explain how the normal process of market competition is not working. Next, it requires the regulator to assess the factual basis for this market failure. Wanting to improve a product or service is admirable but falls far short of justifying regulatory intervention. First, entrepreneurs in a competitive market already have an incentive to improve their offerings. Second, regulations that have not explicitly identified a systemic market failure necessitating correction are less effective than those that identify and address the fundamental problem.60 Third, as we have noted, by undermining competition, regulations often make matters worse.  Identify Alternative Solutions Once a systemic market failure has been identified, a number of alternative approaches to address it should be identified as well. Ultimately, there may be no need for regulatory intervention if other approaches resolve the problem better or more efficiently than regulation would.61 The list of potential alternatives should also include the alternatives of deregulation and of doing nothing, as well as an open-minded assessment of how the current set of public policies might be contributing to the problem.  57.

M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  16  Define the Costs of Each Solution Once all the alternatives have been identified, it is important to understand what the projected costs of each approach will be, including the projected costs of doing nothing. In particular, what might regulated firms, taxpayers, and consumers have to give up under each potential alternative? These costs will include monetary expenditures\xe2\x80\x94higher prices, taxes, and fees\xe2\x80\x94and nonmonetary sacrifices such as loss of convenience or increased wait times. These costs also include the amount of time and money that firms waste in rent-seeking activity, as well as the productive inefficiencies that tend to arise when firms are protected from competition. Dynamic losses that accrue over time, such as an industry\xe2\x80\x99s failure to adopt new technologies and entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x99 failures to improve their business models, must also be accounted for.  Define and Quantify the Expected Benefits of the Regulation Once the costs of each alternative are understood, it is necessary to weigh them against the benefits of each approach. This evaluation can begin with questions about what regulators hope to accomplish\xe2\x80\x94which systemic market failures they hope to diminish\xe2\x80\x94and how each alternative might achieve these goals. Policymakers should remember that maintaining the profits of incumbent firms is not a legitimate goal because amounts exceeding normal profits come at the expense of both consumers and would-be competitors.  Measure Benefits and Costs Ultimately, once a systemic market failure has been identified and alternative solutions have been put forward, it is not enough to simply posit a theory of how each approach might create costs and benefits. Both costs and benefits must be defined, measured, and quantified in a scientific, technical way. Whenever possible, an objective understanding of both the costs and benefits is necessary for ensuring that the best, most efficient approach is selected. When an objective understanding is impossible, regulators should acknowledge that certain judgments are subjective.  SUGGESTED REFORMS FOR THE DFHV As we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously noted, the strongest justification for regulating the market for traditional street-hailed taxis was that the market suffered from \xe2\x80\x9casymmetric information\xe2\x80\x9d problems. Again, because passengers knew little about the past  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  17  performance of potential taxi drivers, the proper route and price for a desired trip, or other aspects that would help them decide from whom to accept rides, some might be reluctant to jump into an unknown cab. Some analysts worried that if these problems were systemic, they could lead to an underdeveloped market, which meant that both consumers and producers might be better off if there were a way to overcome these asymmetries. These arguments are still used to justify the litany of taxi regulations implemented by the DFHV and other state and local taxi regulators around the country. But in some ways, these regulations have long ignored market mechanisms that mitigate the asymmetric information problem. For example, individual and company behavior is subject to tort law; companies post bonds\xe2\x80\x94which can vary depending on each driver\xe2\x80\x99s history and record\xe2\x80\x94that will be forfeited in the event that they are found liable for harm; firms develop well-recognized brands whose reputations they are incentivized to vigorously protect; and firms have long sought certification from third parties such as the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Reports, and Angie\xe2\x80\x99s List. Beginning some 15 to 20 years ago, a new generation of consumer-driven technologies such as Yelp and Google Review empowered consumers to dramatically lessen the asymmetric information problem. And as we explained in the previous section, smartphone applications have enabled even better and more timely customer feedback, further mitigating many previous asymmetric information problems.62 Because the basic structure of the regulatory approach is decades old, it ignores these technological innovations that have substantially solved the asymmetric information problem. As a result, policymakers need to radically reconsider current taxi regulations.  Suggested Solutions As we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, the primary role of the regulator is to protect consumer welfare. If information asymmetries are the basic problem in the vehicle-for-hire industry, then the most logical responses are remedies aimed at filling those information gaps and empowering potential passengers and drivers to make better decisions.63 As technology policy scholar Adam Thierer and his coauthors have noted, \xe2\x80\x9cModern reputation tracking and feedback mechanisms, in  62. For more on reputation feedback mechanisms, see Thierer et al., \xe2\x80\x9cHow the Internet, the Sharing Economy, and Reputational Feedback Mechanisms Solve the \xe2\x80\x98Lemons Problem.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d 63. Ibid.  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  18  combination with the various online review sites and information services, accomplish this objective by disclosing more information to consumers, thus putting them in a position to make better decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d64 They continue, Moreover, these emergent market developments ultimately leverage the dispersed knowledge of each individual user, rather than relying on the information that a single regulator is able to collect. These information-sharing systems allow individuals to provide instant feedback regarding the quality of products and services, and they empower others to utilize this information in a way that traditional solutions never could.65 Because of the development of Internet- and smartphone-based r\xad eputation-tracking and feedback mechanisms, coupled with the near ubiquity of smartphones in America,66 it is becoming increasingly difficult to claim that information asymmetries exist in any market. As a result, the primary solution we suggest is a full repeal of taxi regulations. Barriers to entry at the firm, driver, and vehicle levels should be dramatically reduced if not altogether eliminated. Price mandates should be abolished. And there should be no exhaustive rules governing how businesses are to specifically operate or provide services to customers. A number of local governments are beginning to adopt this approach. Florida may be the best example. There, localities such as Collier County and the cities of Sarasota, Gainesville, and Melbourne have adopted an approach that recognizes the alternative private-market solutions to information asymmetries.67 With this policy change, regulators are making way for continued innovation and competition in information sharing as entrepreneurs find new and more efficient means of providing better information to those who seek it. These changes stand to bring the transportation-service industry in line with much of the rest of the economy.  64. Ibid., 44. 65. Ibid. 66.

Larger cities, such as Indianapolis, Indiana, managed to take major steps toward deregulating taxis nearly two decades ago. See, e.g., Adrian T. Moore, \xe2\x80\x9cIndianapolis\xe2\x80\x99s Road to Regulatory Reform: A New Path in Licensing and Permits,\xe2\x80\x9d Regulation 21, no. 1 (Winter 1998): 50\xe2\x80\x9356.  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  19  It is our judgment that technological advancements have largely overcome the asymmetric information problem in the taxicab industry. If policymakers disagree but nevertheless share our concern that the current approach is not working, then an alternative would be to devise simple regulations that clearly address the goal of mitigating asymmetric information problems but allow entrepreneurs to devise their own means of achieving this goal. For example, policymakers could impose the simple and open-ended requirement that firms offer their customers some way of prescreening for quality, safety, and price. It is impossible to know in advance what solutions will be optimal since the process of competition is a discovery procedure.68 Indeed, it is unlikely that there is one optimal solution, since customers with different preferences and different financial means will find different solutions to their liking. Moreover, what appears to be the optimal solution today will likely change as consumer preferences, available technology, and other factors continue to evolve over time. Consider the limitless ways in which vehicle-for-hire and ridesharing firms might allow customers to prescreen prices. Some might post their going rate in a large font on the side of their cars. Others might widely advertise their rates at popular locations such as airports. And still others might alert customers via text message, voice mail, or smartphone application. Or consider the range of strategies that firms might adopt to allow customers to prescreen for quality and safety: \xe2\x80\xa2  Some firms, of course, might adopt the sorts of FBI background checks that are currently required.  \xe2\x80\xa2  But others might differentiate themselves with background checks that are more comprehensive than those offered by the FBI or by local police departments.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Others might allow passengers to see, through their own smartphones or through a smartphone provided by the driver, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s average and maximum speeds or number of citations, or previous customers\xe2\x80\x99 reviews. This screening method could be much more informative than a one-off background check, and it could update in real time (note that some insurance companies already use similar technology to allow policyholders to prove that they are good drivers and thereby to get discounts).  \xe2\x80\xa2  Other firms might differentiate themselves through creative incentives for good driving. For example, they might monitor drivers in real time through  68. Hayek, \xe2\x80\x9cCompetition as a Discovery Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  20  GPS technology and reward drivers for safe driving or punish them for speedy or reckless driving. \xe2\x80\xa2  Others could require drivers to post large bonds that would be surrendered to passengers or to the firm in the event that they violate certain rules.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Still others could simply employ driverless vehicles, which would require no background check at all and provide a much safer ride than human drivers.69  The range of options is vast, and we have no doubt that others will be able to come up with far better solutions than those we suggest here. The key, however, is to ensure an open-ended and competitive process that permits experimentation. That process can only be achieved by rules that specify the goals without anchoring firms to particular means of achieving those goals.  The Benefits and Costs of Regulatory Change and the Status Quo It is important to explicitly consider the benefits and costs of each approach. In this section, we briefly review the benefits and costs of complete deregulation. Both theory and experience suggest that full deregulation will permit supply to increase and new business models to emerge. As the supply curve shifts to the right, prices will likely fall, and the quantity of rides taken will likely increase.70 These changes will affect different market participants differently. When supply increases, consumers  69. Adam Thierer and Ryan Hagemann, \xe2\x80\x9cRemoving Roadblocks to Intelligent Vehicles and Driverless Cars\xe2\x80\x9d (Mercatus Working Paper, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, September 2014). 70. This analysis assumes that that the current regulated price is above that which would emerge in a competitive market. This assumption is supported by the empirical evidence for the interest-group theory of regulation and by the fact that the equilibrium price for (unregulated) ridesharing firms is below the (regulated) taxi rate.  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  21  \xe2\x80\x9cBoth theory and experience suggest that full deregulation will permit supply to increase and new business models to emerge.\xe2\x80\x9d  can be expected to benefit from lower prices, access to a larger quantity of vehicles, and a greater variety of services offered by providers. In economic terms, consumer surplus\xe2\x80\x94the total value that all consumers obtain from the service in excess of the price that they pay\xe2\x80\x94will likely increase. The producer side is slightly more nuanced. Producer surplus\xe2\x80\x94the total value that all producers obtain in excess of cost\xe2\x80\x94will also likely increase. In fact, because both consumer and producer surplus are expected to increase, deregulation will likely increase the overall efficiency of the market. But among producers, some will benefit while others will not. In particular, firms and operators currently locked out of the market will clearly benefit from the opportunity to enter and serve customers. But some firms that are currently protected from competition by regulation will be harmed as new competition and the elimination of price floors cause the equilibrium price to fall. For these individuals and firms, the sunk costs of regulatory compliance, such as investments in certain technologies and past years\xe2\x80\x99 fees, will remain \xe2\x80\x9csunk\xe2\x80\x9d and unrecoverable.71 But deregulation is not expected to be all bad for incumbent firms and their drivers. For example, they will be relieved of certain marginal costs such as the cost of purchasing DFHV licenses, which will save each firm hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year. Similarly, deregulation will relieve them of the frustrations of the application and renewal processes. Onerous operating requirements will be gone, allowing drivers and companies to use whatever vehicles and technologies their customers desire. Furthermore, they will be spared the cost of investing in antiquated or inefficient equipment, which will allow existing taxi vehicles to be converted to alternate, more profitable uses. Finally, deregulation may prove especially rewarding to incumbent firms that take the opportunity to innovate and create new, more profitable business models that are currently forbidden. It is important to note, however, that whatever losses incumbent firms may experience from deregulation will be more than offset by gains to consumers and other entrants as both consumer and producer surplus increase. Deregulation will also promote efficiency by permitting relative prices to adjust as tastes and technology change, directing resources to their highest-valued uses.72 71. Firms profit from anticompetitive regulations in the short run. But over the long run, the value of these regulations tends to be capitalized into the price of certain assets that are necessary to gain access to protection. This means that protected firms tend not to outperform unprotected firms over the long run. Tullock, \xe2\x80\x9cTransitional Gains Trap.\xe2\x80\x9d 72. When firms enter or expand, other firms will see their prices fall. But such \xe2\x80\x9cpecuniary externalities\xe2\x80\x9d are efficient, and unlike \xe2\x80\x9ctechnological externalities,\xe2\x80\x9d they do not need correcting. Unfortunately, the political process often ignores this fact. A. C. Pigou, The Economics of Welfare, 2nd ed. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 1924); Tibor Scitovsky, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Concepts of External Economies,\xe2\x80\x9d  M ERC ATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MA SON U NIVERSIT Y  22  Deregulation will also have indirect benefits. For example, these changes will likely lead to an increase in the overall productivity of the region, since passengers will waste less time waiting for taxis. Although decreased wait times yield relatively small benefits per person, the summed magnitude can be surprisingly large. In addition, lower fares and increased provision of transportation services are likely to be especially beneficial to poorer people who struggle with access to transportation.  CONCLUSION The current approach to taxicab regulation in the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x94as in most cities and states throughout the United States\xe2\x80\x94is increasingly difficult to justify. Regulatory rules\xe2\x80\x94and legislative acts mandating rules\xe2\x80\x94that were intended to improve the customer experience by mitigating the problem of asymmetric information have backfired. These rules governing price, entry, and operation have shielded incumbent firms from competition and deprived customers of the benefits of price competition and quality improvement. They have locked in old business models and antiquated technologies, benefiting incumbent firms at the expense of consumers and would-be competitors. Although the regulatory approach has changed little over the decades, tastes and technology have substantially evolved. Ridesharing firms operating outside taxi regulators\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction have responded to these changes with lower prices and innovative service offerings. In fact, many of these new service offerings, such as customer reviews and real-time geolocational tracking through smartphones, appear to address the market imperfection of asymmetric information better than the regulations that govern taxis. Even as ridesharing expands the overall size of the transportation-services market, taxi companies that have long benefited from regulatory protections are losing market share to ridesharing firms. This market shift presents the question of what to do with the existing regulatory regime for taxis. In our analysis, the best option for those interested in maximizing consumer welfare, producer efficiency, and social well-being is to follow the lead of the above-mentioned localities in Florida and Indiana and completely deregulate the taxicab market. There should be no barriers to entry at the firm, vehicle, or driver levels. There should be no price mandates. And there should be no exhaustive rules governing business operations or service provision.

In short, competition and new technologies enabling better communication between drivers and riders address the asymmetric information problem more effectively than decades-old taxi regulations. For those policymakers who are unpersuaded by this evidence but nevertheless share our concern that the current regulatory regime undermines consumer welfare, we suggest replacing the existing regulations on entry, price, and operations with a simple \xe2\x80\x9copenended\xe2\x80\x9d regulation that requires firms to offer their customers some way to prescreen for price, quality, and safety but allows firms to develop their own means of achieving this end.  73.

The initial reaction of many regulators to the advent of \xe2\x80\x9cridesharing\xe2\x80\x9d platforms such as Uber and Lyft was either to outlaw them or to burden them with the same level of regulations as taxis. But policymakers are now beginning to take a new approach. They are aiming to achieve regulatory parity between ridesharing platforms and taxis by deregulating taxis. In a new study, \xe2\x80\x9cRethinking Taxi Regulations: The Case for Fundamental Reform,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercatus research fellows Michael Farren and Christopher Koopman and senior research fellow Matthew Mitchell determine that taxi regulation is outdated in light of the transformative technology changes and business innovations of the last few years. Now is an opportune time for fundamental reform of the entire regulatory regime to create a fair, open, and competitive transportation market. BACKGROUND: CURRENT APPROACH TO TAXI REGULATION Most US cities, including the District of Columbia, extensively regulate the taxicab industry. These regulations are often defended on the theory that customers lack sufficient information to make good decisions about taxi drivers, companies, prices, and proper routes. The purpose of detailed regulation of the companies, their drivers, and their cars is to solve this alleged problem of informational disparity in the market. The District of Columbia for-hire industry, while less regulated than that of other cities such as New York, still shoulders a considerable burden, amounting to 33 regulatory procedures and up to $2,643 in costs to drive a single car as a taxi. \xe2\x80\xa2  Regulations impacting drivers. Drivers must submit multiple forms, including a medical history, letters of recommendation, a criminal background history, a driving record, and proof of tickets paid. Further, they must pay hundreds of dollars in fees to drive.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Regulations impacting vehicles. Before a car can be driven as a taxi in DC, it must have several additions installed, including a taximeter (costing $150), an approved dome light (costing as much as $700), and\xe2\x80\x94in some cases\xe2\x80\x94a vehicle condition monitoring device (costing between $100 and $169). The vehicle must also get a standard paint job (costing between $400 and $600) to comply with coloring and marking regulations, submit to annual inspections, and comply with vehicle retirement rules. Additionally, taxi companies must pay a licensing fee of $275 per vehicle.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Regulations for operation. The District also sets rates and fees for customers, imposes procedures for collecting and remitting surcharges, and requires drivers to offer printed receipts. The regulations further mandate that drivers carry sufficient cash, display taxirelated signs and identification, maintain a record of all trips, carry insurance, and follow requirements regarding where and how passengers can be picked up.  COSTS OF REGULATION VS. BENEFITS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY Taxi Regulations Impose Significant Costs and Harm Consumers Taxi regulations undermine personal choice, voluntary exchange, and free and open entry. These regulations are often defended on the grounds that they protect consumers, but economists have demonstrated that protective regulations can undermine consumer welfare. \xe2\x80\xa2  The taxicab industry has \xe2\x80\x9ccaptured\xe2\x80\x9d the regulatory process so that regulations serve the interests of established taxi firms rather than the interests of consumers and newcomers.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Many of the regulatory requirements, such as price controls, licensing fees, and mandated business practices, have undermined competition and growth in the industry to the detriment of consumers.  New Technology Is Changing the Industry Ridesharing firms such as Uber and Lyft operate outside of the taxicab regulatory process and employ new technology to interact with consumers. \xe2\x80\xa2  Between 2014 and 2016, business travelers increased their use of ridesharing firms from 8 percent to 46 percent, while they decreased their use of taxicabs from 37 percent to 14 percent.  \xe2\x80\xa2  There are many benefits to the new ridesharing technology. It allows consumers to give feedback on their drivers and vice versa. This capacity for instant feedback ensures consistent, high-quality service because future consumers and drivers can understand more about each other before entering into a transaction.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Ridesharing technology also decreases costs for consumers. In the District of Columbia, taxi fare estimates were 80 percent to 310 percent higher than UberX fare estimates, based on a sampling of some popular DC routes. These data demonstrate that consumers can benefit from the new technologies.  2  CONCLUSION Taxi regulations limit competition, thereby yielding higher prices, lower quality, and antiquated technologies and practices. Now is an opportune time to rethink the entire structure of taxi regulations. Policymakers should start with a blank slate, identifying the systemic market failure that the regulations aim to address and then proposing alternative solutions with their expected benefits and costs. These alternatives should include the option of no regulation. Only then can ridesharing regulatory policies best serve consumers.  3  ' https://www.mercatus.org/publication/rethinking-taxi-regulations-fundamental-reform
