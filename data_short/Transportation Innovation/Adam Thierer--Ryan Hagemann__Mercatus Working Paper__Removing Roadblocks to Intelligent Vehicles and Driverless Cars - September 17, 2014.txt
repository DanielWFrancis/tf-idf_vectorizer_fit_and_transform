We argue that the generally unabated advancement of intelligent-vehicle technology will produce significant economic and social benefits. Where public policy must be adjusted to address concerns about intelligent vehicles, it should be with an eye toward maximizing the potential for permissionless innovation to work the same magic here that it has in so many other sectors of the economy. Many vehicles already include various computer-operated safety functions, which operate independently of driver action. Even if there is some initial unease, or if the current higher cost of intelligent vehicles limits initial willingness to purchase them, demand for these technologies will likely expand in coming years.1 As the efficacy of intelligent-vehicle technology improves and costs fall such that these vehicles become more ubiquitously available to a growing market of potential consumers, citizens will become more comfortable with these systems.2 This is particularly likely in light of the enormous benefits associated with intelligentvehicle technology, especially autonomous-vehicle technology. \xe2\x80\x9cThis new technology has the potential to reduce crashes, ease congestion, improve fuel economy, reduce parking needs, bring mobility to those unable to drive, and over time dramatically change the nature of US travel,\xe2\x80\x9d  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 1  Susan Thurston, \xe2\x80\x9cBottom Line with Driverless Cars: Will People Buy Them?,\xe2\x80\x9d Tampa Times, February 17, 2014, http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/bottom-line-with-driverless-cars-will-people-buy-them/2166010. 2 Lou Fancher, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Drive: Self-Driving Cars Are Closer Than They Appear,\xe2\x80\x9d SF Weekly, February 19, 2014, http://www.sfweekly.com/2014-02-19/news/google-self-driving-cars-center-for-automotive-research-darpa/full.  \t\r \xa0  3  \t\r \xa0 notes an Eno Center for Transportation report on the impact of driverless cars.3 They will also greatly enhance convenience and productivity for average Americans by freeing up time spent behind the wheel. Thus, while it is true, as a recent Rand Corporation report noted, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe history of technology in general\xe2\x80\x94and transportation in particular\xe2\x80\x94is littered with promising ideas that never achieved widespread adoption,\xe2\x80\x9d it seems unlikely that intelligent vehicles will meet a similar end.4 Various technical and policy barriers to more widespread adoption remain, however, and misguided regulation could delay or curtail the adoption of this important technology. This paper argues that a general embrace of permissionless innovation can help overcome those hurdles. We also argue that policymakers should keep in mind that individuals have gradually adapted to similar disruptions in the past and that, generally speaking, patience and humility are the wise policy virtues when considering what to do about highly disruptive technologies. Living in fear of hypothetical worst-case scenarios and basing policy on them will mean that the best-case scenarios associated with intelligent vehicles will never come about. Thus, patience and regulatory forbearance is generally the wise policy disposition at this time, bearing in mind that the tort system will continue to evolve to address harms caused by intelligent-vehicle systems.  A Brief History of Intelligent Vehicles Few technologies have played a more central role in American society over the past century than the automobile. From their inception, cars were a highly disruptive force, upending other modes \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 3  Eno Center for Transportation, Preparing a Nation for Autonomous Vehicles: Opportunities, Barriers and Policy Recommendations (Washington, DC: Eno Center for Transportation, October 2013), 17, https://www.enotrans.org /wp-content/uploads/wpsc/downloadables/AV-paper.pdf. 4 James M.

Any major changes in the way automobiles work will, therefore, have serious economic and social ramifications.

In the early days, automakers were likely caught up in the era of Buck Rogers\xe2\x80\x93style futurism, but by the mid-late 1950s GM, along with the Radio Corporation of America, \xe2\x80\x9chad developed a scale model \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 5  Jean-Pierre Bardou, The Automobile Revolution: The Impact of an Industry (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1982). 6 Charlie White, \xe2\x80\x9cCar Tech Outlook: Self-Driving Cars Are Just around the Corner,\xe2\x80\x9d Mashable, June 23, 2013, http://mashable.com/2013/06/23/self-driving-cars-3. 7 Cutts, \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Road to Driverless Cars,\xe2\x80\x9d Technology Trends to Watch 2014 (Arlington, VA: Consumer Electronics Association, 2014), 12. 8 Ibid. 9 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \xe2\x80\x9cPreliminary Statement of Policy Concerning Automated Vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d (May 2013), 1, http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/Automated_Vehicles_Policy.pdf.  \t\r \xa0  5  \t\r \xa0 automated highway system, which allowed them to begin experimenting with how electronics could be used to steer and maintain proper following distance.\xe2\x80\x9d10 The experiments never achieved practical implementation.

Fast-forward to 1989, when engineers at Carnegie Mellon successfully navigated an ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network) using \xe2\x80\x9cimages from a camera and a laser range finder\xe2\x80\x9d to automatically direct the vehicle along the roadway. Their conclusion suggested \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of a novel adaptive autonomous navigation system capable of tailoring its processing to the conditions at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d11 Sensor-based technology driven by microprocessors set the standard for future advances in automated robotics, as evidenced by the fact that all the vehicles that won DARPA\xe2\x80\x99s 2004, 2005, and 2007 Grand Challenges were based on this type of technology.12 Meanwhile, as of April 2014, Google\xe2\x80\x99s driverless vehicles had racked up more than 700,000 miles of crash-free driving.13 Definitions are evolving rapidly in this space.

NHTSA has identified a range of five different levels of vehicle automation, ranging from a vehicle in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe driver is in complete and sole control of the primary vehicle controls . . . at all times\xe2\x80\x9d (level 0) all the way to a vehicle designed so \xe2\x80\x9cthe driver will provide destination or navigation input, but is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip\xe2\x80\x9d (level 4).17 Table 1 describes these five NHTSA categories. Today\xe2\x80\x99s vehicles already feature many level 1 \xe2\x80\x9cfunction-specific automations,\xe2\x80\x9d such as electronic stability control and parking assist. Increasingly, manufacturers are offering level 2 \xe2\x80\x9ccombined function automations\xe2\x80\x9d and even some level 3 \xe2\x80\x9climited self-driving automations,\xe2\x80\x9d although those are currently limited to higherend luxury models.  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  14  Bryant Walker Smith, \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d (working paper, Stanford Law School, Center for Internet and Society, Stanford, CA, November 1, 2012), 9, http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu /publications/automated-vehicles-are-probably-legal-united-states. 15 Bryant Walker Smith, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Other Car Is a . . .

must be present in the vehicle in order to reassert manual control if necessary.22 Nevada has also crafted a licensing framework for driverless cars, mandating driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses for the operators of such vehicles.23 As of early 2014, over a dozen states were already studying driverless-car policies or devising licensing requirements, with California and Florida permitting the same type of R&D-testing permits as Michigan.24 Most recently, Johnson County, Iowa, became one of the first areas in the United States to explicitly permit driverless cars on public city streets.25 In terms of regulatory hurdles for testing purposes, Daniel McGehee, director of the Human Factors and Vehicle Safety Research division at the Public Policy Center of the University of Iowa, indicated that Iowa \xe2\x80\x9cwould present fewer bureaucratic hurdles than other states\xe2\x80\x9d to implementing self-driving cars. When asked about the need for investment in infrastructure to accommodate the vehicles, McGehee noted that only high-contrast paint on the roads would be required because \xe2\x80\x9cself-driving cars rely on their own sensors . . . to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s around them.\xe2\x80\x9d26 Whether the implementation process goes smoothly or runs into roadblocks remains to be seen. As with many emerging technologies, legal and regulatory frameworks have yet to catch up with the speed of innovation in this area.

At this stage, policymakers should focus on clearing away existing roadblocks to the growth of intelligent vehicles and exercise restraint regarding the hypothetical concerns about their use. No doubt, challenges will arise as these technologies take off. There has already been some resistance to early forms of autonomous vehicles and even some concern about \xe2\x80\x9csmart car\xe2\x80\x9d technologies, especially on privacy grounds, which will be discussed below.27 In this paper, we address some of these early policy concerns about driverless cars and promote \xe2\x80\x9cbottom-up\xe2\x80\x9d solutions to ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, permissionless innovation continues to flourish in this space. \xe2\x80\x9cPermissionless innovation\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the notion that experimentation with new technologies and business models should generally be permitted by default.28 Unless a compelling case can be made that a new invention poses a serious immediate threat to public well-being, innovation should be allowed to continue unabated; problems, if they develop at all, can be addressed later. Permissionless innovation has been the primary driver of entrepreneurialism and economic growth in many sectors of the economy.29 The most notable modern example of the power of permissionless innovation at work has been the development of the Internet and the  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 27  Craig Timberg, \xe2\x80\x9cWeb-Connected Cars Bring Privacy Concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d Washington Post, March 5, 2013, http://www .washingtonpost.com/business/technology/web-connected-cars-bring-privacy-concerns/2013/03/05/d935d990-80ea -11e2-a350-49866afab584_story.html. 28 Adam Thierer, Permissionless Innovation: The Continuing Case for Comprehensive Technological Freedom (Arlington, VA: Mercatus Center at George Mason University, 2014). 29 Adam Thierer, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Permissionless Innovation Matters,\xe2\x80\x9d Medium, April 24, 2014, https://medium.com /challenging-the-status-quo/257e3d605b63.  \t\r \xa0  10  \t\r \xa0 enormous economic and social benefits it has generated.30 As an open and lightly regulated platform, the Internet allows entrepreneurs to try new business models and offer new services without seeking the approval of regulators beforehand. Its very architecture is premised on this style of innovation. This same open model, as opposed to the policies of a \xe2\x80\x9cprecautionary principle,\xe2\x80\x9d should guide policy in the developing space of autonomous vehicles.31 The \xe2\x80\x9cprecautionary principle\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the belief that new innovations should be curtailed or disallowed until their developers can prove that they will not cause any harm to individuals, groups, specific entities, cultural norms, or various existing laws or traditions.32 Policymakers often adopt precautionary policy approaches in an attempt to preemptively head off potentially risky scenarios or unfortunate outcomes. When public policy is based on the precautionary principle, however, it poses a serious threat to technological progress, economic entrepreneurialism, social adaptation, and long-run prosperity. Put simply, living in constant fear of worst-case scenarios\xe2\x80\x94and premising public policy on them\xe2\x80\x94means that best-case scenarios will never come about.33 In concrete terms, precautionary-principle policymaking results in fewer choices, lower-quality goods and services, diminished economic growth, and a decline in the overall standard of living. Thus, despite being well-intentioned, precautionary-principle-based regulatory constraints can produce unintended consequences that undermine the very goal they were meant to serve.  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 30  Vinton Cerf, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep the Internet Open,\xe2\x80\x9d New York Times, May 24, 2012, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25 /opinion/keep-the-internet-open.html. 31 As Eli Dourado puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cAdvocates of the Internet are right to extol the permissionless innovation model\xe2\x80\x94but they are wrong to believe that it need be unique to the Internet. We can legalize innovation in the physical world, too.

As the late political scientist Aaron Wildavsky showed, wisdom and prosperity are born of experimentation and experience. We learn how to be wealthier and healthier as individuals and as a society only by first being willing to embrace uncertainty and even occasional failure. By contrast, if we adopt a trial without error attitude (i.e., a precautionary-principle-based mindset), the results will be disastrous, as Wildavsky noted: The direct implication of trial without error is obvious: If you can do nothing without knowing first how it will turn out, you cannot do anything at all. An indirect implication of trial without error is that if trying new things is made more costly, there will be fewer departures from past practice; this very lack of change may itself be dangerous in forgoing chances to reduce existing hazards. . . . Existing hazards will continue to cause harm if we fail to reduce them by taking advantage of the opportunity to benefit from repeated trials.34 \t\r \xa0 For similar reasons, we argue that the generally unabated advancement of intelligentvehicle technology will, on net, benefit everyone individually and society as a whole. Where public policy must be adjusted to accommodate disruptive changes, it should be with an eye toward maximizing the potential for permissionless innovation to work the same magic here that it has in so many other sectors of our economy. Many policy recommendations in this space currently revolve around getting ahead of what might become problematic issues for intelligent vehicles, especially driverless cars. Instead of focusing on what might occur, policy prescriptions should assess what issues currently require resolution and how best to achieve them with minimal disruption of innovation. The most advantageous course, for individuals and society alike, is to keep the door open to new ideas and ongoing experimentation. We can think of this disposition as \xe2\x80\x9cdynamism.\xe2\x80\x9d  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  34  \t\r \xa0  Wildavsky, Searching for Safety (New Brunswick, CT: Transaction Books, 1988), 38.  12  \t\r \xa0 In her 1998 book The Future and Its Enemies, Virginia Postrel contrasted the conflicting worldviews of \xe2\x80\x9cdynamism\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstasism\xe2\x80\x9d and showed how the tensions between these two visions would affect the course of future human progress.35 Postrel made the case for embracing dynamism\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca world of constant creation, discovery, and competition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94over the \xe2\x80\x9cregulated, engineered world\xe2\x80\x9d of the stasis mentality. Permissionless innovation is rooted in dynamism; the precautionary principle is based on stasis thinking. Importantly, Postrel argued that we should \xe2\x80\x9csee technology as an expression of human creativity and the future as inviting\xe2\x80\x9d and reject the idea \xe2\x80\x9cthat progress requires a central blueprint.\xe2\x80\x9d Dynamism defines progress as \xe2\x80\x9ca decentralized, evolutionary process\xe2\x80\x9d in which mistakes are not viewed as permanent disasters but instead as \xe2\x80\x9cthe correctable by-products of experimentation.\xe2\x80\x9d36 In sum, they are learning experiences. The crucial takeaway from Wildavsky\xe2\x80\x99s and Postrel\xe2\x80\x99s works is that not every complex economic or social problem requires a convoluted legal regime or heavy-handed regulatory response. We can achieve reasonably effective safety, security, and privacy without always layering on more and more law and regulation. \xe2\x80\x9cDynamic systems are not merely turbulent,\xe2\x80\x9d Postrel noted. \xe2\x80\x9cThey respond to the desire for security; they just don\xe2\x80\x99t do it by stopping experimentation.\xe2\x80\x9d37 She adds, \xe2\x80\x9cLeft free to innovate and to learn, people find ways to create security for themselves. Those creations, too, are part of dynamic systems. They provide personal and social resilience.\xe2\x80\x9d38 To the extent that more serious problems develop or persist, public policy can always be adjusted to address those issues after careful evaluation of the costs and benefits of proposed rules.  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 35  Postrel, The Future and Its Enemies (New York: The Free Press, 1998), xv. Ibid., xiv. 37 Ibid., 199. 38 Ibid., 202. 36  \t\r \xa0  13  \t\r \xa0 All this is applicable to intelligent vehicles. Through ongoing trial-and-error experimentation, both individuals and society as a whole will gradually develop solutions to vexing problems while also acclimating to new technological realities. But attempting to foresee and plan for all these problems will only derail the many potential benefits associated with these technologies. As Rep. Tom Petri (R-WI), chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has wisely cautioned, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are going to be many issues with driverless vehicles, and it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to anticipate all\xe2\x80\x94or even most\xe2\x80\x94of them. Congress should try to maintain a flexible system that deals with real problems rather than a system that tries to anticipate solutions for problems that don\xe2\x80\x99t exist yet.\xe2\x80\x9d39 That is sound advice for all federal, state, and local policymakers who are considering rules for intelligent vehicles. Finally, some philosophers claim that autonomous vehicles create ethical issues, including the question of how they should be programmed to respond during life-and-death situations.40 We discuss some of these issues below and concede that some thorny ethical questions will arise with the advent of more autonomous vehicle systems.

We first consider some of the economic effects associated with intelligent vehicles before turning to social considerations.  General Economic Effects Transportation economists Clifford Winston and Fred Mannering argue that \xe2\x80\x9cthe private sector is developing new technological innovations, especially the driverless car, which will eventually leapfrog the technology that the public highway authorities could and should implement today, thus providing road users with most of the potential bene\xef\xac\x81ts from technological advances in highway travel.\xe2\x80\x9d43 \xe2\x80\x9cThese impacts will have real and quantifiable benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d the Eno Center for \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 43  Clifford Winston and Fred Mannering \xe2\x80\x9cImplementing Technology to Improve Public Highway Performance: A Leapfrog Technology from the Private Sector Is Going to Be Necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d Economics of Transportation (2014): 2, 6\xe2\x80\x937, http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/02/improving-highway-performance-winston.  \t\r \xa0  15  \t\r \xa0 Transportation notes, because more than 30,000 people die each year in the United States in automobile collisions, and \xe2\x80\x9cdriver error is believed to be the main reason behind over 90 percent of all crashes.\xe2\x80\x9d44 These driver errors include drunk driving, distracted operators, failure to remain in one\xe2\x80\x99s lane, and a failure to yield the right of way. The total annual costs of such accidents amount to over $300 billion, or 2 percent of US GDP.45 The current generation of intelligent-vehicle technology (lane-departure warnings, pedestrian detection, parking assist, adaptive cruise control, etc.) is already yielding many safety benefits and will offer even more as the technology grows more sophisticated and drivers make the transition to newer vehicles.46 But completely driverless cars will likely have an even greater impact.47 On balance, driverless vehicles will save lives by preventing harm from bad drivers, even if a driverless vehicle is not necessarily superior to an alert driver in every situation. For instance, the response time of a computer directing the primary functions of a vehicle, informed by an advanced sensor suite capable of calculating and recalculating changing positions and circumstances in fractions of a second, is bound to respond better than the average driver. While a computer won\xe2\x80\x99t be 100 percent perfect 100 percent of the time, it will likely come much closer to achieving a level of control and awareness that no human could claim to possess. According to the Eno Center for Transportation, the annual economic benefits of 50 percent market penetration of driverless cars (that is, 50 percent of all vehicles on the road being fully autonomous vehicles) are estimated to include 9,600 lives saved, almost 2 million fewer \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 44  Eno Center, Preparing a Nation for Autonomous Vehicles, 17, 3.

Essentially, the more computer-operated vehicles deployed on the roads, the less room for human-initiated driving errors, allowing for higher vehicle speeds at closer intervals. It could be the case that total miles traveled would actually increase because of the additional persons who would now be able to use their own cars but that congestion would nonetheless fall thanks to smart-car technology.  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  48  Eno Center, Preparing a Nation, 8.

A November 2013 report from Morgan Stanley estimated that autonomous cars could contribute $1.3 trillion in annual savings to the US economy, with global savings estimated at more than $5.6 trillion.53 A decline in costs for fuel and accidents, as well as $507 billion in annual productivity gains, would drive these savings. In 2011, analysts with the Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group forecasted an estimated $810 of the $1,400 in value per connected vehicle per year could be freed up by reducing the cost of crashes and congestion.54 \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 53  Morgan Stanley, \xe2\x80\x9cAutonomous Cars: Self-Driving the New Auto Industry Paradigm,\xe2\x80\x9d Morgan Stanley Research, November 6, 2013, http://www.morganstanley.com/public/11152013.html. 54 Andreas Mai and Dirk Schlesinger, Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group, \xe2\x80\x9cA Business Case for Connecting Vehicles: Executive Summary,\xe2\x80\x9d Point of View (April 2011), 5, http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/mfg /Connected-Vehicles_Exec_Summary.pdf.  \t\r \xa0  18  \t\r \xa0 There would be enormous, but hard to quantify, benefits that accrue to elderly and disabled citizens from the deployment of intelligent vehicles. These benefits come in two forms\xe2\x80\x94direct and indirect. The direct benefits would include the increasing ease of mobility for elderly and disabled persons who might otherwise be restricted in their ability to transport themselves in automobiles. In terms of indirect benefits, one important consideration is that, once elderly and disabled individuals have more mobility options, new economic and social opportunities will open up not only for them but for many others. Autonomous vehicles would also have an added indirect benefit in that they are likely to decrease accidents associated with attempts by some elderly and disabled individuals to operate vehicles on their own. These combined direct and indirect benefits will, therefore, improve societal well-being enormously in terms of both convenience and safety. This is particularly important because of the higher risk factors associated with senior drivers. Los Angeles Times reporter Brett Berk notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe collision rate for older drivers is among the highest of any age group. Seniors are surpassed only by teenagers and entitled millennials when it comes to per capita insurance damage claims. And older drivers have one of the highest rates of traffic fatalities per mile driven, in part because they lack resilience to recover from injuries sustained.\xe2\x80\x9d55 Indeed, NHTSA reports that in 2012, 5,560 people 65 and older were killed and 214,000 injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

Here, the development of computers holds an important comparison. As Peter Singer of the Brookings Institution has noted, \xe2\x80\x9cFor hundreds of years, there was a highly skilled profession of men who did mathematics for hire. They were well paid, many making the equivalent of $200,000 a year. They were called \xe2\x80\x98calculators.\xe2\x80\x99 They have gone the way of so many other professions reshaped by new technology like the blacksmith making horseshoes or the elevator operator.\xe2\x80\x9d60 Intelligent-vehicle technologies will likely have similarly disruptive impacts on various sectors and professions, resulting in significant short-term economic perturbations and employment dislocations. Mechanics and auto repair shops may end up servicing fewer customers due to the diminished likelihood of accidents. On the other hand, just as mechanical vehicles require regular upkeep, so too will autonomous vehicles. So, it may be the case that such establishments will simply need to retrain their workers to accommodate these changes. Instead of hiring and training pure mechanics, businesses might begin fusing fundamental IT skills with traditional automotive repair skills. After a certain amount of time, some mechanics might be skilled enough to move over to higher-paying jobs somewhere in the information sector. We cannot discount the possibility that a new technology will kill off a large sector; nor can we assume away the possibility that all industries will adapt to new advances in technology.61 For some, the \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  60  Singer, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Predator Comes Home: A Primer on Domestic Drones, Their Huge Business Opportunities, and Their Deep Political, Moral, and Legal Challenges,\xe2\x80\x9d Brookings Institution, March 8, 2013, http://www.brookings .edu/research/papers/2013/03/08-drones-singer. 61 Robert Atkinson, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Robots Don\xe2\x80\x99t Kill Jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d ROS Industrial, May 9, 2014, http://rosindustrial.org/news/2014 /5/9/why-robots-dont-kill-jobs.  \t\r \xa0  21  \t\r \xa0 change may come gradually. But it will demand new business models and worker retraining to accommodate the dynamic nature of the modern auto market. New skills will be needed, but it is entirely possible, even likely, that such skills will be developed in on-the-job scenarios (especially considering that older vehicles will still require routine tune-ups and repairs for the foreseeable future). Other sectors or professions may not be as fortunate. The rise of autonomous vehicles could radically disrupt, and perhaps even drive into extinction, some industries or jobs. This technology could eventually eliminate the jobs of cabbies, bus drivers, and truckers.62 What then is to become of these workers? Perhaps traditional taxi and bus service will come to an end, but as with any technological change, it will come in incremental steps as market forces slowly shift indicators of profitable, long-term careers away from these industries and toward new and emerging sectors. In fact, for cabbies, some of these first steps are being taken, not by driverless cars, but by fully manual vehicles manned by ordinary drivers. Users of services like Uber, Sidecar, and Lyft can essentially operate as unlicensed taxi operators, and the traditional regulatory scheme of \xe2\x80\x9cmedallions, inspections, minimum wages, regulated fares, and \xe2\x80\x98consumer protections\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d is turning out to be largely irrelevant for the American public.63 Concerns about sectoral disruption or worker displacement should not forestall the advancement of autonomous vehicles.64 After all, what would have happened if the regulators of the early 20th century had put a swift end to the development of the automobile for the sake of \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  62  Brian Fung, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Will Happen to Truck Drivers When Self-Driving Vehicles Take Over?,\xe2\x80\x9d Washington Post, The Switch (blog), November 20, 2013, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/20/what -will-happen-to-truck-drivers-when-self-driving-vehicles-take-over. 63 Ira Stoll, \xe2\x80\x9cTech Innovation Outstrips Government Obstructionism,\xe2\x80\x9d Reason, January 20, 2014, http://reason.com /archives/2014/01/20/tech-innovation-outstrips-government-obs. 64 Matthew Mitchell, \xe2\x80\x9cShare and Share Alike: Regulatory Burdens Threaten to Overwhelm Sharing Services Like Uber and Airbnb,\xe2\x80\x9d US News and World Report, April 15, 2014, http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic -intelligence/2014/04/15/uber-airbnb-and-letting-the-sharing-economy-thrive?src=usn_tw.  \t\r \xa0  22  \t\r \xa0 the established industries of carriage drivers and woodworkers whose livelihoods depended on the construction, maintenance, and operation of horse-drawn wagons?

In a world of driverless cars, where accidents are curtailed, most of those premiums go away,\xe2\x80\x9d he notes.67 Needless to say, this could upend the way the vehicle-insurance market works.68 There are already \xe2\x80\x9claws in Florida and D.C.

Challenging questions about liability remain, however.70 If a car drives itself, who then is liable in the event of a crash?71 Is it the auto manufacturer? The software designer? \xe2\x80\x9cThe answer will be developed over time, as will the impact on insurance liability, and it may depend on the situation,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Consumer Reports.72 \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jack Cutts, \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial system and the court of public opinion will figure that one out.\xe2\x80\x9d73 Legal standards here could evolve gradually through a body of common-law cases, the same way they have for traditional automobiles and many other technologies. It would be unwise to hinder the deployment of these technologies in an attempt to plan for every hypothetical risk scenario. This is what the tort system is for; it deals with product liability and accident compensation in an evolutionary way through a variety of mechanisms, including strict liability, negligence, design-defects law, failure to warn, breach of warranty, and so on.74 Indeed, as Brookings scholar John Villasenor has noted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen confronted with new, often complex, questions involving products liability, courts have generally gotten things right. . . .

Liability norms may also shift as driverless technology makes auto ownership less necessary.76 Cars could become used more as a service than a final good; if so, most of the responsibility for their upkeep and safety would likely transfer to the owner of the fleet of cars and away from the end user, who would no longer own a vehicle but instead just order a ride as necessary.77 Furthermore, as Bryant Walker Smith of Stanford Law School notes, in liability law, \xe2\x80\x9ca seller who can, does, or should know more about the products it sells may be expected to foresee a wider range of product-related uses, misuses, and harms.\xe2\x80\x9d78 Therefore, as manufacturers come to possess a greater volume of data about the operation of vehicles and are in a position to take steps to avoid or correct potential risks, their liability will likely ratchet up over time.79 They will become what economists refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9cleast cost avoider,\xe2\x80\x9d or the party who is in the best position to minimize risk at the lowest cost.80 \xe2\x80\x9cThe current stance could also potentially be changed to assign more liability to manufacturers, especially if a point were reached whereby users were no longer expected to even oversee the autonomous driving of their car,\xe2\x80\x9d notes \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  75  Villasenor, \xe2\x80\x9cWho Is at Fault When a Driverless Car Gets in an Accident?,\xe2\x80\x9d Atlantic, April 25, 2014, http://www .theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/04/who-is-at-fault-when-a-driverless-car-gets-in-an-accident/361250. 76 Eric Jaffe, \xe2\x80\x9cImagine: A World Where Nobody Owns Their Own Car,\xe2\x80\x9d Atlantic Cities, February 13, 2014, http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2014/02/imagine-world-where-nobody-owns-their-own-car/8387; Emily Badger, \xe2\x80\x9cDriverless Vehicles Will Force Us to Rethink Car Ownership,\xe2\x80\x9d Washington Post, Wonkblog, April 18, 2014, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/18/driverless-vehicles-will-force-us-to-rethink -car-ownership. 77 Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s, Autonomous Vehicles, 6. 78 Smith, \xe2\x80\x9cProximity-Driven Liability,\xe2\x80\x9d Georgetown Law Journal, 102 (forthcoming), http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3 /papers.cfm?abstract_id=2336234. 79 As Smith explains, \xe2\x80\x9cSince a product use or misuse that should be known to the seller is likely to be foreseeable, this information can also expand the content of other duties.\xe2\x80\x9d Ibid. 80 Steven Shavell, Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University, 2004), 189.  \t\r \xa0  25  \t\r \xa0 Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s.81 \xe2\x80\x9cIf such changes were to occur, motor insurance could change substantially to be something more like product liability insurance. Insurers would need to know less about the users of a car, and more about different models of cars themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d82 Some residual liability might be left with the user if they still own their vehicle, however, or if they interfere with the intelligent driving systems in the vehicles they use. Some, like attorneys John F. O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke and Patrick Soon, fear that \xe2\x80\x9cif liability shifts to the manufacturer, auto makers may lose their incentive to produce self-driving automobiles\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cif liability can be shifted to deep-pocket manufacturers, there is a risk that industry leaders could be sued into bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d83 They suggest that lawmakers may need to immunize autonomous vehicle manufacturers from liability to ensure innovation is not derailed. In America\xe2\x80\x99s litigationintensive system\xe2\x80\x94which also lacks a \xe2\x80\x9closer-pays\xe2\x80\x9d rule to disincentivize frivolous claims\xe2\x80\x94they may have a valid concern. But preempting the evolution of the tort system in this regard should be the last, not first, resort. Moreover, even if some litigation ensues, insurance markets could evolve to handle liability concerns and claims. For that reason, \xe2\x80\x9cinsurers should be allowed to experiment with innovative insurance products to manage this evolving risk landscape,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Marc Scribner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.84 As a recent Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s report noted, The insurance industry\xe2\x80\x99s expertise in risk management will be a factor in the adoption of autonomous and unmanned technology. In an area where regulation and safety standards are yet to be developed, insurers can encourage prudent progress by making their own risk assessments and providing policies for responsible operators. There is an opportunity for insurers to engage in the transfer of new risks, making it possible for continued technological innovation. This technological innovation may give rise to new business opportunities, with corresponding opportunities for insurers.85 \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 81  Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s, Autonomous Vehicles, 19.

Yes, computer-guidance systems and the rest will require advances in technology, not to mention redundancy and higher standards of performance, but at least these are all feasible, and capable of quantifiable improvement. On the other hand, we\xe2\x80\x99ll always have lousy drivers.87 \t\r \xa0 Viewed in this light, autonomous vehicles might be a solution to many of the dangers that plague our roads. Instead of focusing on potential disruptions to existing sectors or to liability norms, perhaps our real concern should be with perpetuating a status quo in which human error plays so significant a role in automobile accidents.88 Consequently, as Villasenor correctly argues, \xe2\x80\x9cpreemptively resolving liability issues should not be a precondition to commercial rollout of autonomous vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d89 The cost of delay in terms of human lives, health, property damage, convenience, and more is very real.

While this may necessitate the development of prohibitively expensive \xe2\x80\x9csmarter\xe2\x80\x9d roads and highways, it is equally as plausible to imagine that infrastructure investment would be minimal.91 Unfortunately, the costs of such investments are not yet apparent. However, as suggested by the Rand Report cited earlier, these upgrades might be unnecessary, because \xe2\x80\x9cmost current efforts are focused on developing [autonomous vehicles] that do not depend on specialized infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d92 Indeed, it is possible that the onboard technology in driverless cars may become so sophisticated in coming years that they will be able to adapt to almost any circumstance or road condition. Before we can assess the costs and benefits of such investments, however, it will be necessary to define what these new environments might look like. As transportation consultant Nat Bottigheimer puts it, those \xe2\x80\x9cofficials responsible for parking lot and garage building, transit system growth, bike lane construction, intersection expansions, sidewalk improvements, and road widenings need to analyze quantitatively how self-driving cars could affect their plans, and to prepare alternatives in case things change.\xe2\x80\x9d93 There is one area of established roadways that could benefit immensely from intelligent-vehicle technology: intersections. Computer scientists Joe Palca and Kurt Dresner have been working on developing \xe2\x80\x9csmart intersections\xe2\x80\x9d that would increase traffic flow to 10 times its current speed by using car-to-intersection communication systems. The idea, according to Palca, is that you would have \xe2\x80\x9ca four-way intersection with each road carrying five lanes of traffic. With light traffic, cars just zoom through. But with heavier traffic, even \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 91  Rand, Autonomous Vehicle Technology, 68.

This means that many existing traffic rules, and current infrastructure necessities like stoplights, could be altered or abandoned entirely as intelligent vehicle technologies make driving closer at higher speeds possible. It remains unclear, however, whether all vehicles would need to be fully autonomous for such benefits to arise. Interoperability among technical standards and other systems may be another issue. The technology currently being designed and tested by Google \xe2\x80\x9ccombines information gathered from Google Street View with artificial intelligence software that combines input from video cameras inside the car, a LIDAR [laser imaging, detection and ranging] sensor on top of the vehicle, radar sensors on the front of the vehicle and a position sensor attached to one of the rear wheels that helps locate the car\xe2\x80\x99s position on the map.\xe2\x80\x9d95 By contrast, BMW and Mercedes are developing technology that relies on real-time sensors to \xe2\x80\x9crecognize what is around them.\xe2\x80\x9d96 Each variation possesses its own benefits and only time will determine the ideal system of automation.

Experimentation with varying standards can have many benefits, and picking efficient standards ex ante is notoriously difficult.97 A different but potentially equally pressing infrastructure issue concerns access to adequate wireless spectrum.98 Many current intelligent vehicle systems rely on dedicated shortrange communications (DSRC) systems to operate properly. Rand reports that DSRC \xe2\x80\x9cis intended to enable short-range wireless communications both between vehicles and between vehicles and roadside infrastructure\xe2\x80\x94to support, especially, safety applications such as intersection collision avoidance\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cis also available for non-safety messages, vehicle diagnostics, and even commercial transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d99 A 2012 report on autonomous vehicles from the Center for Automotive Research and KPMG argued that \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently, DSRC offers the greatest promise, because it is the only short-range wireless alternative that provides all of the following: fast network acquisition, low latency, high reliability, priority for safety applications, interoperability, [and] security and privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d100 Nonetheless, adequate access to wireless spectrum for DSRC\xe2\x80\x94and the technical standards that should govern the use of that spectrum\xe2\x80\x94 remain the subject of intense debate between various intelligent-vehicle stakeholders as well as federal and state regulatory agencies.101 With competing technical standards of both a licensed \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 97  Adam Thierer, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Is \xe2\x80\x98Optimal Interoperability\xe2\x80\x99?

Rand notes that \xe2\x80\x9cas [autonomous vehicle] technology improves, it will spur further demand for connectivity anyway, because drivers will have more time and attention available for things other than focusing on the road. For mobile communications carriers, this means increasing demand for spectrum to support voice and video applications. The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s policymaking in the current proceeding concerning the 5.9 GHz band may have far-reaching implications that will either accelerate or inhibit deployment of DSRC and AVs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \t\r \xa0  30  \t\r \xa0 and unlicensed nature, the potential for interference exists within that spectrum range, which worries some intelligent-vehicle companies. Some believe that major spectrum advancements will be necessary for use by intelligent vehicle innovators if these technologies are to reach their promise. German auto giant BMW has noted that so-called \xe2\x80\x9c5G\xe2\x80\x9d networks\xe2\x80\x94the next major evolution of high-speed mobile broadband systems\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccould be vital in providing the mission-critical reliability as it seeks to deploy selfdriving cars onto city streets.\xe2\x80\x9d102 \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to support a large number of driverless vehicles on highways, you need 5G networks and all the extra capacity they deliver,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Dominic Basulto of the Washington Post.103 5G systems will be significantly faster, have broader coverage, be far more spectrum-efficient, and have lower latency than current systems.104 But 5G and other advanced licensed and unlicensed wireless systems will require legislators and regulators at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to open up more wireless spectrum, which may be challenging in the short term given the many other sectors and innovators also clamoring for more spectrum. As they work to free up more spectrum, it is important that policymakers not attempt to micromanage these spectrum uses in an overly rigid fashion. Unfortunately, Congress and the FCC have traditionally \xe2\x80\x9czoned\xe2\x80\x9d spectrum for specific uses, freezing markets and innovation in place according to rapidly outmoded market contours and technological designs.105  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 102  Matthew Finnegan, \xe2\x80\x9cBMW: 5G Is Key to Self-Driving Car Deployment,\xe2\x80\x9d ComputerWorld UK, February 14, 2014, http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/mobile-wireless/3501253/bmw-5g-could-be-key-self-driving-car -deployment. 103 Basulto, \xe2\x80\x9cFive Reasons to Get Excited about 5G Networks,\xe2\x80\x9d Washington Post, February 27, 2014, http://www .washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/02/27/five-reasons-to-get-excited-about-5g-networks. 104 See Gary Arlen, \xe2\x80\x9cMultiple Cable Options for Broadcom\xe2\x80\x99s 5G Chip,\xe2\x80\x9d Multichannel News, February 26, 2013, http://www.multichannel.com/blogs/i-was-saying/multiple-cable-options-broadcoms-5g-chip. 105 See Thomas W.

This is especially true of transportation infrastructure. As Winston and Mannering observe, it is \xe2\x80\x9chardly surprising that the government has impeded technological advance in public highways and quite possible that the private sector could spur an advance if given an opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d107 They conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthe public sector will not make the required investments in the near future to improve highway infrastructure technology; in contrast, the private sector is clearly determined to perfect and implement driverless cars. Thus, driverless car technologies are quite likely to effectively leapfrog most of the existing technologies that the public sector could but has failed to implement to improve highway travel.\xe2\x80\x9d108  A Brief Note on Taxation Another important consideration for policymakers is the effect of taxation on this developing technology. Taxation of intelligent vehicles should be as limited, noninvasive, and nonstifling as possible in order to ensure development of such technologies is not discouraged. While the ideal solution would be no tax at all, it is unlikely that the onset of autonomous vehicles will come without any tax scheme.

As Scribner astutely pointed out in a Washington Post editorial, \xe2\x80\x9cno one knows precisely how autonomous vehicle technology will develop or be adopted by consumers.

Thus, we would expect one of the first actual concerns to involve the existence of autonomous cars driving side by side with manually operated vehicles. \xe2\x80\x9cDrivers are likely to become accustomed to semi-autonomous driving, particularly in certain conditions such as stopstart traffic jams or flowing motorway traffic,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s.114 Can the roadways be shared between the two? As this process unfolds, various social and cultural tensions are likely to develop, especially as they relate to personal security and privacy. This section deals with those and other social considerations.  Cultural Resistance and Social Adaptation As we give up more and more control over driving, some might lament the loss of the traditional American romance with cars and the open road.115 The insatiable appetite for the freedom of the road is, for many, a historically significant component of what it means to be an American.116 From the tinkering hobbyist and the speed demon to the muscle-car magnate and road-tripping 20-something, experiencing the vast expanse of interstate roadways is about on par with mom\xe2\x80\x99s apple pie as one of the cultural touchstones of modern America. One might argue that, if we lose direct control of our cars, we lose a little piece of what it means to be American. Perhaps that loss is more than some consumers will be able or willing to stomach at first, but the reality is that \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 113  Quoted in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s, Autonomous Vehicles, 9.

Indeed, citizen attitudes about these technologies likely will follow a familiar cycle we have seen play out in countless other contexts. That cycle typically witnesses initial resistance, gradual adaptation, and then eventual assimilation of a new technology into society.117 Many new technologies, including the automobile itself, were initially resisted and even regulated because they disrupted long-standing social norms, traditions, and institutions. Despite these fears, individuals adapted in almost every case and assimilated new technologies into their lives. Technologies that are originally viewed as intrusive or annoying often become not just accepted but even considered essential in fairly short order. Just as that was the case with the first automobile, the telephone,118 the camera,119 radio, television, and the Internet,120 it will likely also be true with intelligent vehicles. How quickly will people come to adapt to a technology as potentially life-altering as cars that are so smart they drive themselves? According to a July 2013 CEA Survey, when asked what activity people would prefer to engage in while operating a driverless vehicle, 81 percent indicated they would watch the road (see figure 1).

There are currently numerous cars that are already commercially available and include intelligent safety technologies. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Volvo S60\xe2\x80\x99s Pedestrian Detection system, Mercedes SClass PRE SAFE and DISTRONIC collision-detection radar, or the Lexus LS Advanced PreCollision System, intelligent driving and safety technology is already being incorporated into many cars.122 A recent study by engineers at Virginia Tech University examined a sample of 2,848 collisions resulting from unintended lane departures between 2007 and 2011. They find that by incorporating lane departure warning systems into the vehicles involved in these accidents, 30.3 percent of the crashes could have been avoided. The associated reduction of injuries resulting from lane departure accidents was estimated at 25.8 percent.123 Another study examining the effects of forward collision warning systems finds \xe2\x80\x9cfar greater differences, preventing as few as 9 percent and as many as 53 percent of rear-end collisions.\xe2\x80\x9d124 As the integration of semi- and fully autonomous systems becomes more ubiquitous, and as their efficacy increases and produces substantial benefits, the sense of unease that may exist among some today will dissipate. Eventually, we will likely come to view these systems as ideal features of modern transportation. Again, change comes gradually in a fashion that permits us to grow accustomed to the inclusion of the new technology in our lives.  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 122  Nick Jaynes, \xe2\x80\x9cSmarter, Safer, Self-Driving: 4 (Almost) Autonomous Cars You Can Own Today,\xe2\x80\x9d Digital Trends, January 31, 2013, http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/autonomy-today-fewer-crashes-tomorrow-five-current-cars -with-autonomous-tech. 123 Philip E.

It is worth noting here that despite the NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s forwardlooking avoidance of preemptive regulations on this particular point, the agency is nonetheless dealing with an archaic and soon-to-be obsolete framework of regulations. Marc Scribner has pointed out that manufacturers, like AAM and Tesla, are currently petitioning the NHTSA to revise their mandate on vehicular mirrors. After all, many sensor suites on current automobiles make mirror appendages redundant and obsolete. This is a prime example of how government regulatory agencies are, going forward, less and less likely to have an effective regulatory scheme; simply put, intelligent-systems technology is advancing too quickly for bureaucratic organizations to adapt. 127 Ibid.  \t\r \xa0  38  \t\r \xa0 Such principles constitute a reasonable assessment of what makes for best practices in testing such technology, and are likely the guidelines framing companies\xe2\x80\x99 approaches to researching these technologies. As with any new technology, there are legitimate concerns over proper standards of safety, not least of which includes the potential for car hacking\xe2\x80\x94a concern that, while a dominant feature of the current discourse in this space, is likely overblown in terms of its severity. Despite valid apprehensions over third parties gaining access to and taking control of autonomous vehicles, current car systems are already prone to being hacked, given the level of automobiles\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on computer systems regulating certain vital functions. Indeed, car hacking is already possible for the vast majority of cars on the roads today. \xe2\x80\x9cAutomobiles have already become sophisticated networks controlled by dozens of computers\xe2\x80\x94called electronic control units (ECUs)\xe2\x80\x94that manage critical, real-time systems,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Scientific American reporter Larry Greenemeier.128 Ryan M. Gerdes, Charles Winstead, and Kevin Heaslip, have suggested that there is another problem with automated transportation system technologies: the potential for what they call efficiency-motivated attacks.129 Such attacks focus on causing a target vehicle to expend excessive energy during travel, potentially \xe2\x80\x9cover four times as much energy as it would otherwise, with an average increase in energy expenditure of 42%,\xe2\x80\x9d with the intent of decreasing the efficiency gains of other autonomous vehicles driving with it. The incentive for such an attack could come, for example, from a trucking firm looking to reduce its competitor\xe2\x80\x99s profit margins by increasing its fleet\xe2\x80\x99s fuel costs or damage its reputation by slowing down delivery times. \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  128  Larry Greenemeier, \xe2\x80\x9cFact or Fiction?: Your Car Is Hackable,\xe2\x80\x9d Scientific American, April 2, 2014, http://www .scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-your-car-is-hackable1. 129 Gerdes, Winstead, and Heaslip, \xe2\x80\x9cCPS: An Efficiency-Motivated Attack Against Autonomous Vehicular Transportation\xe2\x80\x9d (Logan, UT: Utah State University, December 13, 2013), 99\xe2\x80\x93108.  \t\r \xa0  39  \t\r \xa0 However, this concern, as analyzed by Gerdes, Winstead, and Heaslip, applies only in the context of a platoon framework. A platoon in this sense is \xe2\x80\x9cdefined as a group of vehicles cooperating to act as one unit by closely following one another at fixed speeds.\xe2\x80\x9d130 Although some scholars believe the platoon system is the most ideal means of achieving the massive economic impacts discussed earlier in the paper, there is no guarantee such a system will end up being the most effective long-term solution to networking autonomous and intelligent systems, especially as sensor-suite technologies and telematics develop in the coming years. The problems described by Gerdes and his colleagues, therefore, depend on a very narrow conception of how autonomous vehicles might operate and, in particular, on a very specialized form of attack that is unlikely to be an issue in all but the rarest of cases. Furthermore, while such attacks are potentially problematic, it is already \xe2\x80\x9cprobable that a malicious actor could effect the attack against present-day vehicles equipped with automatic cruise control.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus, like other attempts at car hacking, it is not a concern limited to future developments in intelligent-vehicle technology.131 Manufacturers have powerful reputational incentives at stake here, which will encourage them to continuously improve the security of their systems.132 Companies like Chrysler and Ford are already looking into improving their telematics systems to better compartmentalize the ability of hackers to gain access to a car\xe2\x80\x99s controller-area-network bus.

Ibid, 107. 132 \xe2\x80\x9cBecause the failure of an autonomous car has serious implications for human safety, there could be serious reputational risk for the manufacturer of a car or component if it is involved in an accident. This is also the case for the manufacturing of traditional cars\xe2\x80\x94even the suggestion of a fault can affect reputation\xe2\x80\x94but as technology comes to have a larger responsibility for driving, the risk will also increase. The emotional implications of handing over personal safety and responsibility to a machine could lead to volatile public responses to a fault.

And despite a lack of legislation demanding a minimum standard of IT security to prevent hacker attacks on vehicles, automakers are presently \xe2\x80\x9cbeginning to take steps to secure networks the same way the information-technology sector now locks down corporate servers.\xe2\x80\x9d134 Security consultant Javier Vazquez Vidal, who has done research on automobile security vulnerabilities, notes that the public \xe2\x80\x9cshould not panic but know that the security in vehicles is being taken into consideration in order to improve it.

While some individuals might be permissive of private corporations having access to data about their driving activities, many will likely be more wary about the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to intrude into their travel data. If, for example, the government begins toying with regulatory schemata for intelligent cars, who is to say it won\xe2\x80\x99t demand the inclusion of backdoor protocols that permit national intelligence services, local police, or other agencies to not only tap into a car\xe2\x80\x99s onboard communication system, but remotely shut down the vehicle at any given moment?138 The security of vehicles will likely necessitate securitizing our information flows, but the underlying issue surrounding data collection, by the private sector or government, is one of privacy, which is discussed at greater length below.  Ethical Concerns Although security and safety issues are at the fore of the discussion surrounding autonomous and intelligent vehicles, there are more subtle issues for consideration. Among these is the nature of the algorithms that make automated transportation possible. Writing in Wired, philosopher Patrick Lin discusses the ethical implications of algorithms making decisions in no-win situations that must inevitably end in a crash. He argues that \xe2\x80\x9cto optimize crashes, programmers \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 137  Postrel, Future and Its Enemies, 199. \xe2\x80\x9cSecret Documents Reveal N.S.A.

Lin is correct insofar as it is indeed difficult to program software \xe2\x80\x9cfor the hard cases,\xe2\x80\x9d but cases where such a response mechanism would need to be applied are, as Lin himself admits, \xe2\x80\x9cvery rare, if realistic at all.\xe2\x80\x9d140 Autonomous vehicles are unlikely to create 100 percent safe, crash-free roadways, but if they significantly decrease the number of people killed or injured as a result of human error, then we can comfortably suggest that the implications of the technology, as a whole, are a boon to society. The ethical underpinnings of what makes for good software design and computer-generated responses are a difficult and philosophically robust space for discussion. Given the abstract nature of the intersection of ethics and robotics, a more detailed consideration and analysis of this space must be left for future research. Important work is currently being done on this subject.141 But those ethical considerations must not derail ongoing experimentation with intelligent-vehicle technology, which could save many lives and have many other benefits, as already noted.142 Only through ongoing experimentation and feedback mechanisms can we expect to see constant improvement in how \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  139  Lin, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Robot Car of Tomorrow May Just Be Programmed to Hit You,\xe2\x80\x9d Wired, May 6, 2014, http://www .wired.com/2014/05/the-robot-car-of-tomorrow-might-just-be-programmed-to-hit-you. 140 Ibid. 141 Noah J.

Privacy Considerations Concerns over privacy and data collection are among the leading tech-policy issues of the day, and they have already begun bleeding into the debate over intelligent-car systems.143 Some federal lawmakers have already raised concerns about the privacy and security implications of intelligent vehicles.144 Privacy advocates have also sounded the alarm and called for new rules governing intelligent vehicles.145 And a group of 18 US senators led by Sen. John Hoeven (RND) has introduced legislation called the \xe2\x80\x9cDriver Privacy Act,\xe2\x80\x9d which proposes a preemptive framework to govern access to data gathered by vehicle event-data recorders (EDRs).146 In late 2013, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) surveyed 10 companies that produce cars, portable navigation devices, and map and navigation applications for mobile devices. The GAO found that \xe2\x80\x9cAll 10 selected companies have taken steps consistent with some, but not all, industry-recommended privacy practices,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe companies\xe2\x80\x99 privacy practices were, in certain instances, unclear, which could make it difficult for consumers to understand the  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  143  \xe2\x80\x9cConnected Cars Roll into Privacy Concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d InfoSecurity Magazine, January 18, 2014, http://www.infosecurity -magazine.com/view/36480/connected-cars-roll-into-privacy-concerns; Paul A.

This market and these technologies are evolving rapidly. We should not be surprised that many consumers will initially express skepticism\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even revulsion\xe2\x80\x94at the idea of vehicle data being collected and retained. But those expectations will likely evolve over time as the benefits become more evident. For example, vehicle EDRs and integrated diagnostic tools raise some privacy concerns, because they retain data about the user\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle and their driving patterns. But those systems have already been in place for many years in newer-model cars and help ensure that those vehicles operate safely and efficiently. As users gain greater peace of mind about the operation of the machines in which they are driving, they are likely to be more willing to allow those data to be collected and even shared, despite some privacy concerns. Again, it is important to realize that social norms evolve over time and that privacy concerns tend to be highly subjective, amorphous, and ever-changing.149 Privacy concerns \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  147  US General Accountability Office, \xe2\x80\x9cIn-Car Location-Based Services: Companies Are Taking Steps to Protect Privacy, but Some Risks May Not Be Clear to Consumers,\xe2\x80\x9d GAO-14-81, December 2013, http://www.gao.gov /assets/660/659509.pdf. 148 Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cConnected Cars Are Here.

Indeed, many technologies that were originally viewed as intrusive or annoying have become not just accepted but even considered essential in fairly short order.151 This is likely to also be true for intelligent vehicles as individuals grow more accustomed to them. Nonetheless, some legitimate privacy concerns will remain and could hold up progress and adoption of these technologies. Better transparency about intelligent-vehicle data-collection and -use practices will be essential if the auto industry and application developers hope to avoid alienating their customers. Jim Farley, a Ford executive responding to questions about data collection, recently remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cWe know everyone who breaks the law, we know when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing it. We have GPS in your car, so we know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing,\xe2\x80\x9d and, almost as an afterthought, appended, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, we don\xe2\x80\x99t supply that data to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d152 Ford later clarified that Farley was referencing a hypothetical future scenario, in which such data could, in theory, be collected, and that the company was not currently doing so.153 Nonetheless, these potential datacollection capabilities have raised obvious privacy concerns.154 Perhaps the most pressing concern about such data collection is not what Ford might do with it, but what governments \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  150  Larry Downes, \xe2\x80\x9cA Rational Response to the Privacy \xe2\x80\x98Crisis,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Cato Institute, Policy Analysis 716 (January 7, 2013): 10, http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa716.pdf.

Eugene Volokh writes that \xe2\x80\x9cas the NSA PRISM story vividly illustrates, surveillance data collected by private entities can easily be subpoenaed or otherwise obtained by law enforcement agencies, without a warrant or probable cause. What the private sector gathers, the government can easily demand.\xe2\x80\x9d155 Concerns over privacy, though warranted, are not unique to the ongoing development of intelligent vehicles. Much like fears over the ability of car hackers to coopt vehicular control,156 these are issues that will require redress whether autonomous vehicles develop further or not. They should not, therefore, be an argument for forestalling continued innovation in this arena. The focus should instead be on what precisely is being done with these data. Services like OnStar and GPS systems collect location data as a means of providing drivers with the ability to locate services and map routes to their destinations on the fly, leading some to portend that \xe2\x80\x9cthe days of a driver being alerted to a deal at a retailer as he drives nearby are rapidly approaching.\xe2\x80\x9d157 And while the question of how long such data should be retained is worth asking, we should not presume that providing tracking data to private service providers is automatically a bad idea. Rather, we should be asking to whom such data might be transmitted (e.g., law-enforcement agencies, the NSA, insurance companies, marketers), and under what circumstances. It is also important to distinguish between personally identifiable information (PII) and non-PII data.

Under the heading of FIPP, Obama administration privacy reports have generally listed the following principles: Individual Control (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cnotice and consent\xe2\x80\x9d), Transparency, Respect for Context, Security, Access, Accuracy, Focused Collection, and Accountability.159 The administration has advocated that such principles govern private-sector data collection and use and that they be formally enshrined in a congressionally implemented \xe2\x80\x9cConsumer Privacy Bill of Rights.\xe2\x80\x9d160 Congress has not yet acted on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s request, however. That may be because lawmakers understand the challenge of applying FIPP in a strict, legalistic fashion, considering how rapidly technology, business practices, and consumer demands are evolving in the modern economy.161 Multistakeholder processes, which focus on building consensus among diverse constituencies through ongoing meetings and agreements, would be preferable to top-down, one-size-fits-all administrative regulation. \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 158  Future of Privacy Forum, \xe2\x80\x9cConnected Cars Project,\xe2\x80\x9d accessed February 5, 2014, http://www.futureofprivacy.org /connectedcars.

All these considerations and trade-offs are applicable to the privacy considerations surrounding intelligent vehicles. Instead of imposing the FIPP principles in a rigid regulatory fashion, these privacy and security best practices will need to adapt gradually to new realities and be applied in a more organic and flexible fashion. For example, providing consumers with adequate notice and consent for data collection remains a sensible best practice. Likewise, automobile manufacturers and application developers would be wise to be highly transparent about their data-use policies and also limit the amount of overall data collection, keeping it limited to core functions as much as possible. Finally, they should limit retention of those data, limit sharing with too many third parties, and safeguard those data against unauthorized interception. By handling data collection and use in this way, automakers can balance legitimate uses and avoid privacy headaches or data breaches. \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 162  See Thierer, \xe2\x80\x9cFramework for Benefit-Cost Analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d 1055\xe2\x80\x93105.

In the future, some automakers or app developers might craft creative data-sharing policies that provide consumers with myriad unanticipated benefits. Serendipitous discoveries can materialize only in a policy environment that embraces trial-and-error experimentation. That is why flexible and evolving best practices for data collection and use will ultimately serve consumers better than one-size-fits-all, top-down regulatory edicts. The debate over the ownership of data collected by intelligent-vehicle technologies will continue. How much control will consumers have over these systems and the data they collect? Who owns the data collected by the onboard event-data recorders? If a consumer evades or defeats the data-collection system on his vehicle, will that be strictly a contractual matter that voids his warranty with the manufacturer? Or will government mandates requiring EDRs in intelligent vehicles result in some other form of liability for the owner? As with the other security and liability questions discussed in this paper, these issues will play out over time through the common law. Policymakers need not respond to all of them preemptively and ought to be mindful that it is unlikely they have all the right answers at this time. Alas, that has not stopped some federal and state lawmakers from already suggesting a regulatory framework, including the Driver Privacy Act mentioned earlier. Further complicating matters is the patchwork of state laws already developing on this front. As of December 2013, 14 states had also introduced measures governing access to EDR data.165 As states continue to grapple with intelligent-vehicle issues, privacy considerations will \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 165  National Conference of State Legislatures, \xe2\x80\x9cPrivacy of Data from Event Data Recorders: State Statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d accessed April 30, 2014, http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-of -data-from-event-data-recorders.aspx.  \t\r \xa0  50  \t\r \xa0 continue to creep into many of those discussions and a patchwork of conflicting data-use policies may develop.166 At some point, perhaps sooner rather than later, Congress may need to preempt some of these laws in order to make more uniform the policies governing the sale, use, and regulation of intelligent vehicles.167  Embracing Change: General Recommendations to Promote Intelligent Vehicles We can see that the development of intelligent vehicles has the potential to be a boon to quality of life, to promote economic gains, and to advance social progress. As with many other new technologies, however, autonomous vehicles will be highly disruptive to the economy and society, as well as to legal and cultural norms. There will be a sense of unease at first, but at a certain point, we will come to accept the enormous potential this technology has to benefit society. What was true for Henry Ford\xe2\x80\x99s Model T will be equally true for the intelligent vehicles and driverless cars that will soon be on the roads around us. Rather than narrow our gaze toward what is lost in this transition, we should focus on how technological progress improves human welfare in the long run\xe2\x80\x94even for those displaced or inconvenienced by such innovations in the near term. After all, industries in which individuals have previously been displaced as a result of automation are examples of less-skilled jobs being replaced by more technically skilled and economically advantageous positions. Many of those who once toiled in fields and factories, for example, eventually migrated to service-oriented professions that also provided safer working conditions. None of this is to minimize the plight of those who might suffer in the short term as a \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 166  Matthew Heller, \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia Regulators Consider \xe2\x80\x98Big Brother\xe2\x80\x99 Hazards Of Driverless Cars,\xe2\x80\x9d Mint Press News, March 19, 2014, http://www.mintpressnews.com/california-regulators-consider-big-brother-hazards-driverless -cars/186951. 167 Ali, \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment Hitting the Brakes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \t\r \xa0  51  \t\r \xa0 result of this disruption, but were we to forestall such technological progress for the sake of preserving those jobs currently in existence, our economy and society would become a static dystopia of contentment, eschewing progress for stability and sacrificing a future of possibilities for the preservation of the status quo. Although worker-retraining programs are certainly one option for minimizing disruptions in the lives of affected individuals, there are many other alternatives that might be worth examining before defaulting to such programs, which typically do not achieve the results their sponsors desire.168 Considering the significant benefits that could come from fully intelligent vehicles, the primary role for government in this space should be rooted in humility and patience. It is still unclear what shape innovation will take in the coming years and, therefore, forbearance is the wise policy disposition at this time.169 That is especially the case in light of how rapidly these technologies continue to develop and how challenging it will be to preemptively craft rules that can keep pace. In their Autonomous Vehicle Technology report, Rand researchers have explained the challenge of setting regulatory standards that remain relevant: First, regulatory promulgation is fundamentally an iterative and slow process, given the cycles of proposals, requests for comments, reviews, and lobbying that precede rulemaking. Second, with [autonomous vehicle] technologies in particular, their newness and rapid evolution create uncertainty in both rulemaking effects and of the \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  168  This is especially true of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program that, despite a robust half-century of funding, has never achieved its expected outcomes for domestic workers (especially in the manufacturing sector) displaced by foreign trade. To wit, a December 2012 Mathematica report commissioned by the US Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s Employment and Training Administration found that the program\xe2\x80\x99s net benefit to society was negative $53,802 per participant and the net benefit to participants was negative $26,837.

Schochet, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Benefits and Costs of the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program Under the 2002 Amendments,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathematica Policy Research (December 2012). Similar program evaluations in peer-reviewed academic journals have almost unanimously concluded the same.

(\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the lack of demonstrated problems with autonomous or self-driving vehicle use, we think state lawmakers would be wise to refrain from passing laws or developing regulations in this area. As NHTSA noted, evolution is occurring too rapidly and there are too many uncertainties for productive regulation at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d)  \t\r \xa0  52  \t\r \xa0 technology itself. Moreover, with rapid technology changes, it can be challenging to prescribe rules that will remain relevant and appropriate through the development process. A government transportation official we interviewed stated that, when it came to issuing standards, he thought it was extremely difficult to stay relevant, given the swift pace of technological change.170 \t\r \xa0 Importantly, many of the imagined security and privacy problems mentioned above may never materialize, because individuals and organizations could quickly adapt to the new realities of a world filled with intelligent vehicles. On the other hand, unanticipated challenges could develop that require flexible, creative solutions we cannot possibly design a priori. Creative solutions will have to be pursued as those issues develop, because it is impossible to anticipate every possible use or harm scenario in advance. There are, however, a few general prescriptions that ought to guide lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 decisionmaking processes in this space. Legislators should first look to sunset laws that inhibit innovation and experimentation. Some issues that may require more serious political attention include infrastructure and network operations as well as obvious licensing issues. States already have various motor vehicle licensing procedures in place that will need to adapt rapidly to accommodate the rise of driverless cars in coming years. As mentioned earlier, some states have already taken action to do so. Developers of intelligent vehicles should continue to work together, and with policymakers, to overcome both political and technical hurdles to widespread adoption of intelligent-vehicle technologies. The development of clear and fully transparent guidelines and best practices for safety, security, and privacy concerns will be of paramount importance in furthering that goal. But the presence of such concerns need not limit our willingness to allow for continued innovation and trial-and-error experimentation.

Governments possess powers that private entities do not\xe2\x80\x94the power to fine, tax, or even imprison.171 Therefore, when law-enforcement officials seek access to privately held data collected from connected vehicles, strong constitutional and statutory protections should apply. Toward that end, bolstered Fourth Amendment constraints on governmental attempts to access data from connected cars are essential.172 This should include reform of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (the primary federal statute that governs when law-enforcement agencies may compel private entities to divulge information held on behalf of third-party subscribers) to require the government to obtain a warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause before accessing privately held data and communications.173 In short, government collection of data ought to be constrained to the fullest extent possible, while granting consumers the right to engage in clearly defined, consensual arrangements to trade data with producers\xe2\x80\x94arrangements that, unlike nonconsensual government collection, often translate to practical benefits, cheaper systems, and a more robust marketplace for citizens. \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0  171  Adam Thierer, \xe2\x80\x9cDo We Need a Constitutional Amendment Restricting Private-Sector Data Collection?,\xe2\x80\x9d Privacy Perspectives, January 23, 2014, https://www.privacyassociation.org/privacy_perspectives/post/do_we_need_a _constitutional_amendment_restricting_private_sector_data_colle. 172 James X.

Will \xe2\x80\x9cpermissionless innovation\xe2\x80\x9d be our lodestar, allowing individuals to pursue a world of which they can, as of now, only dream? Or will reasoning based on the \xe2\x80\x9cprecautionary principle\xe2\x80\x9d prevail instead, driven by a desire to preserve the world in which we find ourselves now? To the maximum extent possible, we should embrace permissionless innovation for intelligent vehicles. Creative minds\xe2\x80\x94especially those most vociferously opposed to technological change\xe2\x80\x94will always be able to concoct horrific-sounding scenarios about the future. But again, the best-case scenarios will never develop if we are gripped by fear of the worst-case scenarios and try to preemptively plan for them with policy interventions. Although there are many issues to overcome with respect to safety, privacy, liability, and more, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be cowed into fear because of the disruptive impact of these new technologies. As Philip Ross notes, \xe2\x80\x9ceventually it will be positively hard to use a car to hurt yourself or others.\xe2\x80\x9d174 The sooner that day arrives, the better.  \t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0\t\r \xa0 174  \t\r \xa0  Ross, \xe2\x80\x9cRobocar Technologies.\xe2\x80\x9d  55  ' https://www.mercatus.org/publication/removing-roadblocks-intelligent-vehicles-and-driverless-cars b'\t\r \xa0  REMOVING ROADBLOCKS TO INTELLIGENT VEHICLES AND DRIVERLESS CARS _____________________  Intelligent cars are possible today after decades of research and development in vehicle automation and computer processing. Advanced intelligent vehicle technology can bring significant economic and social benefits. Unfortunately, policymakers often impose \xe2\x80\x9cprecautionary principle\xe2\x80\x9d policies on developing technology, stunting growth and discouraging innovation. Though it is well intentioned, trial-without-error policymaking results in fewer choices, lower-quality goods and services, and diminished economic growth. Regulators should not demand that developers prove that intelligent vehicle technology will not cause any harm. In a new study for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, scholars Adam Thierer and Ryan Hagemann argue that \xe2\x80\x9cpermissionless innovation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the primary driver of entrepreneurialism and economic growth in many sectors of the economy\xe2\x80\x94should be the default principle for policymakers addressing the rise of intelligent vehicles. Any perceived or actual problems with new technologies can be corrected later through better-informed policymaking. For the complete study, see \xe2\x80\x9cOvercoming Roadblocks to Intelligent Vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPERMISSIONLESS INNOVATION\xe2\x80\x9d AND INTELLIGENT VEHICLES Policymakers should focus on clearing existing roadblocks to the development of intelligent vehicles, and exercise restraint regarding hypothetical concerns about their use. \xe2\x80\x9cPermissionless innovation\xe2\x80\x9d is the idea that experimentation with new technologies and business models should generally be permitted by default. Permissionless innovation brought the Internet, an open and lightly regulated platform that allows entrepreneurs to adopt new business models and offer new services without first seeking approval from regulators. Increased use of intelligent vehicle technology will bring social and economic challenges, but governments should maintain a flexible system that deals with real problems rather than hypothetical ones. Additionally, the problems that may arise due to intelligent vehicles should be understood in  \t\r \xa0  context. For example, in 2012, 33,561 people were killed and 2,362,000 injured in traffic crashes, largely as a result of human error. Reducing the number of accidents by allowing intelligent vehicle technology to flourish would be a success. If regulators hinder accident-reducing innovative technology, avoidable injuries and deaths will continue unnecessarily. ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS \xe2\x80\xa2  Driver errors resulting in accidents cost $300 billion annually in the United States. While intelligent vehicles will not be 100 percent accurate 100 percent of the time, they will likely achieve a level of control and awareness that no human could possess, thus reducing the economic impact of accidents. Additionally, insurance premiums could fall or even disappear entirely.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Intelligent vehicles will also reduce congestion and lower fuel consumption. In 2011 congestion caused drivers to spend an extra 5.5 billion hours on the road and purchase 2.9 billion gallons of fuel at a cost of $121 billion. Intelligent vehicles will help reduce humaninitiated driving errors, allowing vehicles to travel at higher speeds and closer together, reducing congestion costs.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Increased use of intelligent vehicles may cause some sectors of the economy to change or disappear entirely, such as professional driving of taxis, buses, and trucks. However, policymakers should not choose winners and losers in the market; that benefits entrenched industries, not consumers. If regulators in the early 20th century had curtailed the development of the automobile for the sake of carriage drivers and woodworkers, whose livelihoods depended on horse-drawn carriages, the world might never have seen Henry Ford\xe2\x80\x99s Model T.  SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS  \t\r \xa0  \xe2\x80\xa2  A cultural shift toward roadways with entirely driverless vehicles will not happen overnight: comprehensive change takes time. As consumer demand for intelligent vehicles increases, market penetration will increase in proportion. While some may resist changing traditional cultural norms about hitting the \xe2\x80\x9copen road\xe2\x80\x9d as a driver, eventually most people will accept the benefit and value of accommodating a cultural shift.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Security concerns may slow the adoption of intelligent vehicles, but concerns over remote car-hacking are likely overblown. Manufacturers have powerful reputational incentives to continuously improve the security of their systems and adopt best practices within the industry, much as the information-technology sector has taken steps to secure its networks. Legislation and regulation is unnecessary and could hinder growth in the industry.  \xe2\x80\xa2  Intelligent vehicles also raise privacy concerns. Manufacturers and application developers would be wise to develop best practices for data retention, consumer consent to collection and sharing, and safeguarding collected data. But imposing burdensome privacy regulations during the development of this technology would create complex and costly tradeoffs, 2  possibly resulting in higher costs for consumers, a decrease in content and services, and less competition in the market. EMBRACING CHANGE: GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROMOTE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES The government\xe2\x80\x99s approach here should be guided by humility and patience, allowing intelligent vehicle technology to develop while refraining from overbearing regulation. Lawmakers should sunset any laws that inhibit innovation and experimentation. Policymakers should also examine infrastructure and network operations, as well as licensing issues. In the private sector, businesses should work together and with policymakers to overcome hurdles to the widespread adoption of intelligent vehicle technology, and stakeholders should develop clear and fully transparent guidelines and best practices to allay safety, security, and privacy concerns. Additionally, government data collection should be constrained to the fullest extent possible. Consensual data collection should be allowed between consumers and producers of goods and services, which will translate to practical benefits, cheaper systems, and a more robust marketplace. CONCLUSION Policymakers should embrace permissionless innovation when dealing with intelligent vehicle technologies. They should not live in fear of hypothetical worst-case scenarios related to security, safety, and privacy. While disruptive at times, these new technologies will bring incredible economic and social benefits to society. In the near future, it will be very difficult to use a car to hurt yourself or others. The sooner that day arrives, the better.  \t\r \xa0  3  ' https://www.mercatus.org/publication/removing-roadblocks-intelligent-vehicles-and-driverless-cars
